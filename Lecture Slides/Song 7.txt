Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
You showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson about a naive fool that came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet
Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
And painful scars are all that's left of me
Oh but thank you girl for teaching me brand new ways to be cruel
If I can find my mind now, I guess I'll just leave
And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on
