"THE BOY WHO LIVED","book 1"
"M r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say","book 1"
"that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people","book 1"
"you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just","book 1"
"didn’t hold with such nonsense.","book 1"
"Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made","book 1"
"drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a","book 1"
"very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the","book 1"
"usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her","book 1"
"time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a","book 1"
"small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.","book 1"
"The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and","book 1"
"their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they","book 1"
"could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.","book 1"
"Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley","book 1"
"pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing","book 1"
"husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered","book 1"
"to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The","book 1"
"Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even","book 1"
"seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they","book 1"
"didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.","book 1"
"When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story","book 1"
"starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and","book 1"
"mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley","book 1"
"hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley","book 1"
"gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.","book 1"
"None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.","book 1"
"At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.","book 1"
"Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because","book 1"
"Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.","book 1"
"“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car","book 1"
"and backed out of number four’s drive.","book 1"
"It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of","book 1"
"something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t","book 1"
"realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There","book 1"
"was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in","book 1"
"sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the","book 1"
"light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley","book 1"
"drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was","book 1"
"now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats","book 1"
"couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the","book 1"
"cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a","book 1"
"large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.","book 1"
"But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something","book 1"
"else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that","book 1"
"there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.","book 1"
"Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you","book 1"
"saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He","book 1"
"drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these","book 1"
"weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.","book 1"
"Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that","book 1"
"man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The","book 1"
"nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly","book 1"
"stunt —these people were obviously collecting for something…yes, that would","book 1"
"be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the","book 1"
"Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.","book 1"
"Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the","book 1"
"ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills","book 1"
"that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though","book 1"
"people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after","book 1"
"owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.","book 1"
"Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five","book 1"
"different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit","book 1"
"more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch","book 1"
"his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.","book 1"
"He’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of","book 1"
"them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know","book 1"
"why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and","book 1"
"he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,","book 1"
"clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they","book 1"
"were saying.","book 1"
"“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”","book 1"
"“ — yes, their son, Harry —”","book 1"
"Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the","book 1"
"whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.","book 1"
"He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his","book 1"
"secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished","book 1"
"dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back","book 1"
"down and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being stupid. Potter","book 1"
"wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter","book 1"
"who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew","book 1"
"was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or","book 1"
"Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at","book 1"
"any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…","book 1"
"but all the same, those people in cloaks.…","book 1"
"He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when","book 1"
"he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight","book 1"
"into someone just outside the door.","book 1"
"“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was","book 1"
"a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet","book 1"
"cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the","book 1"
"contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made","book 1"
"passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!","book 1"
"Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself","book 1"
"should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”","book 1"
"And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.","book 1"
"Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete","book 1"
"stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He","book 1"
"was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining","book 1"
"things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of","book 1"
"imagination.","book 1"
"As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw —","book 1"
"and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It","book 1"
"was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the","book 1"
"same markings around its eyes.","book 1"
"“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.","book 1"
"The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat","book 1"
"behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself","book 1"
"into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.","book 1"
"Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all","book 1"
"about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had","book 1"
"learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley","book 1"
"had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report","book 1"
"on the evening news:","book 1"
"“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s","book 1"
"owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at","book 1"
"night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings","book 1"
"of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to","book 1"
"explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The","book 1"
"newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim","book 1"
"McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,","book 1"
"Jim?”","book 1"
"“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not","book 1"
"only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,","book 1"
"Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I","book 1"
"promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people","book 1"
"have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But","book 1"
"I can promise a wet night tonight.”","book 1"
"Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?","book 1"
"Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a","book 1"
"whisper, a whisper about the Potters.…","book 1"
"Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was","book 1"
"no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er","book 1"
"— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?”","book 1"
"As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,","book 1"
"they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.","book 1"
"“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”","book 1"
"“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls…shooting","book 1"
"stars…and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today.…”","book 1"
"“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.","book 1"
"“Well, I just thought…maybe…it was something to do with…you","book 1"
"know…her crowd.”","book 1"
"Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered","book 1"
"whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t","book 1"
"dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about","book 1"
"Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”","book 1"
"“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.","book 1"
"“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”","book 1"
"“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”","book 1"
"“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite","book 1"
"agree.”","book 1"
"He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.","book 1"
"While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom","book 1"
"window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was","book 1"
"staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.","book 1"
"Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the","book 1"
"Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t","book 1"
"think he could bear it.","book 1"
"The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.","book 1"
"Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought","book 1"
"before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no","book 1"
"reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well","book 1"
"what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn’t see how he","book 1"
"and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he","book 1"
"yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them.…","book 1"
"How very wrong he was.","book 1"
"Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on","book 1"
"the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a","book 1"
"statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so","book 1"
"much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls","book 1"
"swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.","book 1"
"A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so","book 1"
"suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.","book 1"
"The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.","book 1"
"Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,","book 1"
"thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both","book 1"
"long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that","book 1"
"swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,","book 1"
"bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long","book 1"
"and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was","book 1"
"Albus Dumbledore.","book 1"
"Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a","book 1"
"street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was","book 1"
"busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize","book 1"
"he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still","book 1"
"staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the","book 1"
"cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”","book 1"
"He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a","book 1"
"silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The","book 1"
"nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the next","book 1"
"lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the","book 1"
"only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which","book 1"
"were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window","book 1"
"now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that","book 1"
"was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back","book 1"
"inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat","book 1"
"down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he","book 1"
"spoke to it.","book 1"
"“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”","book 1"
"He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at","book 1"
"a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the","book 1"
"shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a","book 1"
"cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked","book 1"
"distinctly ruffled.","book 1"
"“How did you know it was me?” she asked.","book 1"
"“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”","book 1"
"“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said","book 1"
"Professor McGonagall.","book 1"
"“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a","book 1"
"dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”","book 1"
"Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.","book 1"
"“Oh yes, I’ve celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think","book 1"
"they’d be a bit more careful, but no —even the Muggles have noticed","book 1"
"something’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the","book 1"
"Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls…shooting","book 1"
"stars…Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice","book 1"
"something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He","book 1"
"never had much sense.”","book 1"
"“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious","book 1"
"little to celebrate for eleven years.”","book 1"
"“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason","book 1"
"to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in","book 1"
"broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”","book 1"
"She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though","book 1"
"hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine","book 1"
"thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared","book 1"
"at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,","book 1"
"Dumbledore?”","book 1"
"“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful","book 1"
"for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”","book 1"
"“A what?”","book 1"
"“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”","book 1"
"“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t","book 1"
"think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who","book 1"
"has gone —”","book 1"
"“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by","book 1"
"his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been","book 1"
"trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor","book 1"
"McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,","book 1"
"seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-","book 1"
"Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s","book 1"
"name.”","book 1"
"“I know you haven’t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half","book 1"
"exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the","book 1"
"only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”","book 1"
"“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will","book 1"
"never have.”","book 1"
"“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.”","book 1"
"“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey","book 1"
"told me she liked my new earmuffs.”","book 1"
"Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said “The","book 1"
"owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what","book 1"
"they’re saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?”","book 1"
"It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most","book 1"
"anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all","book 1"
"day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a","book 1"
"piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying,","book 1"
"she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.","book 1"
"Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.","book 1"
"“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort","book 1"
"turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily","book 1"
"and James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.”","book 1"
"Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.","book 1"
"“Lily and James…I can’t believe it…I didn’t want to believe it…Oh,","book 1"
"Albus…”","book 1"
"Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know…I","book 1"
"know…” he said heavily.","book 1"
"Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not all.","book 1"
"They’re saying he tried to kill the Potter’s son, Harry. But he couldn’t. He","book 1"
"couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that","book 1"
"when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and","book 1"
"that’s why he’s gone.”","book 1"
"Dumbledore nodded glumly.","book 1"
"“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done…","book 1"
"all the people he’s killed…he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding…of","book 1"
"all the things to stop him…but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?”","book 1"
"“We can only guess.” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”","book 1"
"Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her","book 1"
"eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden","book 1"
"watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve","book 1"
"hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It","book 1"
"must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his","book 1"
"pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by","book 1"
"the way?”","book 1"
"“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to","book 1"
"tell me why you’re here, of all places?”","book 1"
"“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family","book 1"
"he has left now.”","book 1"
"“You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried","book 1"
"Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.","book 1"
"“Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t find","book 1"
"two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking","book 1"
"his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come","book 1"
"and live here!”","book 1"
"“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and","book 1"
"uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written","book 1"
"them a letter.”","book 1"
"“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on","book 1"
"the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?","book 1"
"These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I","book 1"
"wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future —","book 1"
"there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know","book 1"
"his name!”","book 1"
"“Exactly.” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his","book 1"
"half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before","book 1"
"he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even remember! Can you","book 1"
"see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready","book 1"
"to take it?”","book 1"
"Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed,","book 1"
"and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting","book 1"
"here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might","book 1"
"be hiding Harry underneath it.","book 1"
"“Hagrid’s bringing him.”","book 1"
"“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as","book 1"
"this?”","book 1"
"“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.","book 1"
"“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor","book 1"
"McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend","book 1"
"to — what was that?”","book 1"
"A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew","book 1"
"steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a","book 1"
"headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge","book 1"
"motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.","book 1"
"If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.","book 1"
"He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He","book 1"
"looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black","book 1"
"hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and","book 1"
"his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms","book 1"
"he was holding a bundle of blankets.","book 1"
"“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did","book 1"
"you get that motorcycle?”","book 1"
"“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing","book 1"
"carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve","book 1"
"got him, sir.”","book 1"
"“No problems, were there?”","book 1"
"“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before","book 1"
"the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over","book 1"
"Bristol.”","book 1"
"Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of","book 1"
"blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jetblack","book 1"

"“Is that where —?” whispered Professor McGonagall.","book 1"
"“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”","book 1"
"“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”","book 1"
"“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself","book 1"
"above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well —","book 1"
"give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”","book 1"
"Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’","book 1"
"house.","book 1"
"“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his","book 1"
"great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very","book 1"
"scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded","book 1"
"dog.","book 1"
"“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!”","book 1"
"“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and","book 1"
"burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it —Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor","book 1"
"little Harry off ter live with Muggles —”","book 1"
"“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be","book 1"
"found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as","book 1"
"Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He","book 1"
"laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside","book 1"
"Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the","book 1"
"three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook,","book 1"
"Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually","book 1"
"shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.","book 1"
"“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying","book 1"
"here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”","book 1"
"“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius his bike","book 1"
"back. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”","book 1"
"Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself","book 1"
"onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the","book 1"
"air and off into the night.","book 1"
"“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said","book 1"
"Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.","book 1"
"Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he","book 1"
"stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of","book 1"
"light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange","book 1"
"and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of","book 1"
"the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.","book 1"
"“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a","book 1"
"swish of his cloak, he was gone.","book 1"
"A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy","book 1"
"under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to","book 1"
"happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One","book 1"
"small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was","book 1"
"special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few","book 1"
"hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the","book 1"
"milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and","book 1"
"pinched by his cousin Dudley....He couldn’t know that at this very moment,","book 1"
"people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and","book 1"
"saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”","book 1"
"THE VANISHING GLASS","book 1"
"N early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their","book 1"
"nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun","book 1"
"rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the","book 1"
"Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly","book 1"
"the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news","book 1"
"report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed","book 1"
"how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of","book 1"
"what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets —","book 1"
"but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a","book 1"
"large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a","book 1"
"computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The","book 1"
"room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.","book 1"
"Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.","book 1"
"His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise","book 1"
"of the day.","book 1"
"“Up! Get up! Now!”","book 1"
"Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.","book 1"
"“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and","book 1"
"then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back","book 1"
"and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one.","book 1"
"There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the","book 1"
"same dream before.","book 1"
"His aunt was back outside the door.","book 1"
"“Are you up yet?” she demanded.","book 1"
"“Nearly,” said Harry.","book 1"
"“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don’t you","book 1"
"dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”","book 1"
"Harry groaned.","book 1"
"“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door.","book 1"
"“Nothing, nothing…”","book 1"
"Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out","book 1"
"of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after","book 1"
"pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because","book 1"
"the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.","book 1"
"When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table","book 1"
"was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though","book 1"
"Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second","book 1"
"television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a","book 1"
"mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course","book 1"
"it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but","book 1"
"he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.","book 1"
"Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry","book 1"
"had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and","book 1"
"skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of","book 1"
"Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin","book 1"
"face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses","book 1"
"held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had","book 1"
"punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance","book 1"
"was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He","book 1"
"had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever","book 1"
"remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.","book 1"
"“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask","book 1"
"questions.”","book 1"
"Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the","book 1"
"Dursleys.","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.","book 1"
"“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.","book 1"
"About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper","book 1"
"and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than","book 1"
"the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair","book 1"
"simply grew that way — all over the place.","book 1"
"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his","book 1"
"mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not","book 1"
"much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on","book 1"
"his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel","book 1"
"— Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.","book 1"
"Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as","book 1"
"there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His","book 1"
"face fell.","book 1"
"“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two","book 1"
"less than last year.”","book 1"
"“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here","book 1"
"under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.”","book 1"
"“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry,","book 1"
"who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon","book 1"
"as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.","book 1"
"Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,","book 1"
"“And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. How’s that,","book 1"
"popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right”","book 1"
"Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said","book 1"
"slowly, “So I’ll have thirty...thirty...”","book 1"
"“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.","book 1"
"“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All right","book 1"
"then.”","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon chuckled.","book 1"
"“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta boy,","book 1"
"Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair.","book 1"
"At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it","book 1"
"while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video","book 1"
"camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He","book 1"
"was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from","book 1"
"the telephone looking both angry and worried.","book 1"
"“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t","book 1"
"take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.","book 1"
"Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every","book 1"
"year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to","book 1"
"adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was","book 1"
"left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry","book 1"
"hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him","book 1"
"look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.","book 1"
"“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though","book 1"
"he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken","book 1"
"her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year","book 1"
"before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.","book 1"
"“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.","book 1"
"“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”","book 1"
"The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there","book 1"
"— or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand","book 1"
"them, like a slug.","book 1"
"“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?”","book 1"
"“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.","book 1"
"“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to","book 1"
"watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on","book 1"
"Dudley’s computer).","book 1"
"Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon.","book 1"
"“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled.","book 1"
"“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.","book 1"
"“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “…","book 1"
"and leave him in the car.…”","book 1"
"“That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone.…”","book 1"
"Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had","book 1"
"been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face","book 1"
"and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.","book 1"
"“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special","book 1"
"day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.","book 1"
"“I…don’t…want…him…t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge,","book 1"
"pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin","book 1"
"through the gap in his mother’s arms.","book 1"
"Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt","book 1"
"Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss,","book 1"
"walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He","book 1"
"was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit","book 1"
"them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.","book 1"
"Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the","book 1"
"back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the","book 1"
"first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else","book 1"
"to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.","book 1"
"“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up","book 1"
"close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at","book 1"
"all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.”","book 1"
"“I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly…”","book 1"
"But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.","book 1"
"The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was","book 1"
"just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.","book 1"
"Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking","book 1"
"as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his","book 1"
"hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that","book 1"
"horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless","book 1"
"night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his","book 1"
"baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to","book 1"
"find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had","book 1"
"been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain","book 1"
"that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly.","book 1"
"Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting","book 1"
"old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to","book 1"
"pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have","book 1"
"fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided","book 1"
"it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.","book 1"
"On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the","book 1"
"roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when,","book 1"
"as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the","book 1"
"chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s","book 1"
"headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d","book 1"
"tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his","book 1"
"cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry","book 1"
"supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.","book 1"
"But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with","book 1"
"Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his","book 1"
"cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.","book 1"
"While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to","book 1"
"complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and","book 1"
"Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.","book 1"
"“…roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a","book 1"
"motorcycle overtook them.","book 1"
"“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly.","book 1"
"“It was flying.”","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around","book 1"
"in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache:","book 1"
"“MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!”","book 1"
"Dudley and Piers sniggered.","book 1"
"“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.”","book 1"
"But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the","book 1"
"Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about","book 1"
"anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a","book 1"
"cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.","book 1"
"It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The","book 1"
"Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and","book 1"
"then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before","book 1"
"they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t","book 1"
"bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head","book 1"
"who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond.","book 1"
"Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to","book 1"
"walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were","book 1"
"starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their","book 1"
"favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley","book 1"
"had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on","book 1"
"top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the","book 1"
"first.","book 1"
"Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to","book 1"
"last.","book 1"
"After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there,","book 1"
"with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and","book 1"
"snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and","book 1"
"Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.","book 1"
"Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its","book 1"
"body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at","book 1"
"the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.","book 1"
"Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the","book 1"
"glistening brown coils.","book 1"
"“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the","book 1"
"glass, but the snake didn’t budge.","book 1"
"“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly","book 1"
"with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.","book 1"
"“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.","book 1"
"Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He","book 1"
"wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company","book 1"
"except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all","book 1"
"day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only","book 1"
"visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got","book 1"
"to visit the rest of the house.","book 1"
"The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised","book 1"
"its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.","book 1"
"It winked.","book 1"
"Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was","book 1"
"watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.","book 1"
"The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised","book 1"
"its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:","book 1"
"“I get that all the time.”","book 1"
"“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the","book 1"
"snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”","book 1"
"The snake nodded vigorously.","book 1"
"“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.","book 1"
"The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at","book 1"
"it.","book 1"
"Boa Constrictor, Brazil.","book 1"
"“Was it nice there?”","book 1"
"The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:","book 1"
"This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to","book 1"
"Brazil?”","book 1"
"As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both","book 1"
"of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS","book 1"
"SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”","book 1"
"Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.","book 1"
"“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by","book 1"
"surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast","book 1"
"no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right","book 1"
"up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.","book 1"
"Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had","book 1"
"vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the","book 1"
"floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the","book 1"
"exits.","book 1"
"As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing","book 1"
"voice said, “Brazil, here I come.… Thanksss, amigo.”","book 1"
"The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.","book 1"
"“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?”","book 1"
"The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea","book 1"
"while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As","book 1"
"far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at","book 1"
"their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car,","book 1"
"Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was","book 1"
"swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least,","book 1"
"was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you,","book 1"
"Harry?”","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before","book 1"
"starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say,","book 1"
"“Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and","book 1"
"Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.","book 1"
"Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn’t","book 1"
"know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.","book 1"
"Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.","book 1"
"He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as","book 1"
"long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died","book 1"
"in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had","book 1"
"died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his","book 1"
"cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a","book 1"
"burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he","book 1"
"couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his","book 1"
"parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was","book 1"
"forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.","book 1"
"When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some","book 1"
"unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the","book 1"
"Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that","book 1"
"strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were,","book 1"
"too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping","book 1"
"with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man,","book 1"
"Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wildlooking","book 1"
"old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.","book 1"
"A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street","book 1"
"the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all","book 1"
"these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a","book 1"
"closer look.","book 1"
"At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated","book 1"
"that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody","book 1"
"liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.","book 1"
"LETTERS FROM NO ONE","book 1"
"T he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever","book 1"
"punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer","book 1"
"holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera,","book 1"
"crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike,","book 1"
"knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.","book 1"
"Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s","book 1"
"gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and","book 1"
"Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of","book 1"
"the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in","book 1"
"Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.","book 1"
"This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,","book 1"
"wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see","book 1"
"a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary","book 1"
"school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had","book 1"
"been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was","book 1"
"going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local","book 1"
"public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.","book 1"
"“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he","book 1"
"told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”","book 1"
"“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as","book 1"
"horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley","book 1"
"could work out what he’d said.","book 1"
"One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his","book 1"
"Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as","book 1"
"usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she","book 1"
"didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and","book 1"
"gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several","book 1"
"years.","book 1"
"That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in","book 1"
"his brand-new uniform. Smeltings’ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange","book 1"
"knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly","book 1"
"sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was","book 1"
"supposed to be good training for later life.","book 1"
"As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said","book 1"
"gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears","book 1"
"and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so","book 1"
"handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of","book 1"
"his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.","book 1"
"* * *","book 1"
"There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went","book 1"
"in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He","book 1"
"went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in","book 1"
"gray water.","book 1"
"“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always","book 1"
"did if he dared to ask a question.","book 1"
"“Your new school uniform,” she said.","book 1"
"Harry looked in the bowl again.","book 1"
"“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”","book 1"
"“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s","book 1"
"old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.”","book 1"
"Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat","book 1"
"down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his","book 1"
"first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin,","book 1"
"probably.","book 1"
"Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of","book 1"
"the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as","book 1"
"usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on","book 1"
"the table.","book 1"
"They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.","book 1"
"“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.","book 1"
"“Make Harry get it.”","book 1"
"“Get the mail, Harry.”","book 1"
"“Make Dudley get it.”","book 1"
"“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”","book 1"
"Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things","book 1"
"lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was","book 1"
"vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and —","book 1"
"a letter for Harry.","book 1"
"Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic","book 1"
"band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no","book 1"
"friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even","book 1"
"got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so","book 1"
"plainly there could be no mistake:","book 1"
"Mr. H. Potter","book 1"
"The Cupboard under the Stairs","book 1"
"4 Privet Drive","book 1"
"Little Whinging","book 1"
"Surrey","book 1"
"The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the","book 1"
"address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.","book 1"
"Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax","book 1"
"seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a","book 1"
"large letter H.","book 1"
"“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you","book 1"
"doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.","book 1"
"Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle","book 1"
"Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow","book 1"
"envelope.","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over","book 1"
"the postcard.","book 1"
"“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny whelk.…”","book 1"
"“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!”","book 1"
"Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the","book 1"
"same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his","book 1"
"hand by Uncle Vernon.","book 1"
"“That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.","book 1"
"“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter","book 1"
"open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster","book 1"
"than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the","book 1"
"grayish white of old porridge.","book 1"
"“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.","book 1"
"Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high","book 1"
"out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a","book 1"
"moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a","book 1"
"choking noise.","book 1"
"“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”","book 1"
"They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and","book 1"
"Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his","book 1"
"father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.","book 1"
"“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.","book 1"
"“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”","book 1"
"“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back","book 1"
"inside its envelope.","book 1"
"Harry didn’t move.","book 1"
"“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.","book 1"
"“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.","book 1"
"“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the","book 1"
"scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door","book 1"
"behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who","book 1"
"would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from","book 1"
"one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.","book 1"
"“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the","book 1"
"address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think","book 1"
"they’re watching the house?”","book 1"
"“Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon","book 1"
"wildly.","book 1"
"“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we","book 1"
"don’t want —”","book 1"
"Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down","book 1"
"the kitchen.","book 1"
"“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer…","book 1"
"Yes, that’s best…we won’t do anything…”","book 1"
"“But —”","book 1"
"“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when we","book 1"
"took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?”","book 1"
"That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something","book 1"
"he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.","book 1"
"“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed","book 1"
"through the door. “Who’s writing to me?”","book 1"
"“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly.","book 1"
"“I have burned it.”","book 1"
"“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.”","book 1"
"“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the","book 1"
"ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which","book 1"
"looked quite painful.","book 1"
"“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been","book 1"
"thinking…you’re really getting a bit big for it…we think it might be nice if you","book 1"
"moved into Dudley’s second bedroom.","book 1"
"“Why?” said Harry.","book 1"
"“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs, now.”","book 1"
"The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt","book 1"
"Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where","book 1"
"Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit","book 1"
"into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he","book 1"
"owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared","book 1"
"around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera","book 1"
"was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next","book 1"
"door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television set, which","book 1"
"he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there","book 1"
"was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at","book 1"
"school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because","book 1"
"Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only","book 1"
"things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched.","book 1"
"From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I","book 1"
"don’t want him in there…I need that room…make him get out...”","book 1"
"Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given","book 1"
"anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter","book 1"
"than up here without it.","book 1"
"Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock.","book 1"
"He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on","book 1"
"purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof,","book 1"
"and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time","book 1"
"yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon","book 1"
"and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.","book 1"
"When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice","book 1"
"to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his","book 1"
"Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one!","book 1"
"‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —’”","book 1"
"With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the","book 1"
"hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground","book 1"
"to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had","book 1"
"grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused","book 1"
"fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon","book 1"
"straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand.","book 1"
"“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry.","book 1"
"“Dudley — go — just go.”","book 1"
"Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had","book 1"
"moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first","book 1"
"letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they","book 1"
"didn’t fail. He had a plan.","book 1"
"The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned","book 1"
"it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole","book 1"
"downstairs without turning on any of the lights.","book 1"
"He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and","book 1"
"get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the","book 1"
"dark hall toward the front door —","book 1"
"“AAAAARRRGH!”","book 1"
"Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on","book 1"
"the doormat — something alive!","book 1"
"Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big,","book 1"
"squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the","book 1"
"foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do","book 1"
"exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour","book 1"
"and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into","book 1"
"the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle","book 1"
"Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.","book 1"
"“I want —” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into","book 1"
"pieces before his eyes.","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed","book 1"
"up the mail slot.","book 1"
"“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they","book 1"
"can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.”","book 1"
"“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”","book 1"
"“Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like","book 1"
"you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of","book 1"
"fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.","book 1"
"On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go","book 1"
"through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the","book 1"
"sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs","book 1"
"bathroom.","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got","book 1"
"out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back","book 1"
"doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he","book 1"
"worked, and jumped at small noises.","book 1"
"On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry","book 1"
"found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two","book 1"
"dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through","book 1"
"the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the","book 1"
"post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia","book 1"
"shredded the letters in her food processor.","book 1"
"“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in","book 1"
"amazement.","book 1"
"* * *","book 1"
"On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking","book 1"
"tired and rather ill, but happy.","book 1"
"“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread","book 1"
"marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —”","book 1"
"Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and","book 1"
"caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters","book 1"
"came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry","book 1"
"leapt into the air trying to catch one —","book 1"
"“Out! OUT!”","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.","book 1"
"When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces,","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming","book 1"
"into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.","book 1"
"“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling","book 1"
"great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five","book 1"
"minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No","book 1"
"arguments!”","book 1"
"He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared","book 1"
"argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up","book 1"
"doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in","book 1"
"the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he","book 1"
"tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.","book 1"
"They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where","book 1"
"they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and","book 1"
"drive in the opposite direction for a while.","book 1"
"“Shake ’em off…shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this.","book 1"
"They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling.","book 1"
"He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five","book 1"
"television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without","book 1"
"blowing up an alien on his computer.","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the","book 1"
"outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and","book 1"
"damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the","book 1"
"windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.…","book 1"
"They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the","book 1"
"next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their","book 1"
"table.","book 1"
"“’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an ’undred","book 1"
"of these at the front desk.”","book 1"
"She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:","book 1"
"Mr. H. Potter","book 1"
"Room 17","book 1"
"Railview Hotel","book 1"
"Cokeworth","book 1"
"Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of","book 1"
"the way. The woman stared.","book 1"
"“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following","book 1"
"her from the dining room.","book 1"
"* * *","book 1"
"“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested","book 1"
"timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he","book 1"
"was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest,","book 1"
"got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went","book 1"
"again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across","book 1"
"a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.","book 1"
"“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late","book 1"
"that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the","book 1"
"car, and disappeared.","book 1"
"It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.","book 1"
"“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I","book 1"
"want to stay somewhere with a television.”","book 1"
"Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and","book 1"
"you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of","book 1"
"television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course,","book 1"
"his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a","book 1"
"coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven","book 1"
"every day.","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,","book 1"
"thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.","book 1"
"“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!”","book 1"
"It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what","book 1"
"looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most","book 1"
"miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no","book 1"
"television in there.","book 1"
"“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his","book 1"
"hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!”","book 1"
"A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather","book 1"
"wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.","book 1"
"“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!”","book 1"
"It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks","book 1"
"and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they","book 1"
"reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the","book 1"
"broken-down house.","book 1"
"The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind","book 1"
"whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and","book 1"
"empty. There were only two rooms.","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four","book 1"
"bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and","book 1"
"shriveled up.","book 1"
"“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.","book 1"
"He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a","book 1"
"chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed,","book 1"
"though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.","book 1"
"As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the","book 1"
"high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy","book 1"
"windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and","book 1"
"made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went","book 1"
"off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor","book 1"
"he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.","book 1"
"The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry","book 1"
"couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his","book 1"
"stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls","book 1"
"of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which","book 1"
"was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven","book 1"
"in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if","book 1"
"the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.","book 1"
"Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the","book 1"
"roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes","book 1"
"to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got","book 1"
"back that he’d be able to steal one somehow.","book 1"
"Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like","book 1"
"that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the","book 1"
"rock crumbling into the sea?","book 1"
"One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds...twenty…ten…","book 1"
"nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three…two…one…","book 1"
"BOOM.","book 1"
"The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door.","book 1"
"Someone was outside, knocking to come in.","book 1"
"THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS","book 1"
"B OOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.","book 1"
"“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly.","book 1"
"There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the","book 1"
"room. He was holding a rifle in his hands – now they knew what had been in the","book 1"
"long, thin package he had brought with them.","book 1"
"“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!”","book 1"
"There was a pause. Then —","book 1"
"SMASH!","book 1"
"The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and","book 1"
"with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.","book 1"
"A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost","book 1"
"completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but","book 1"
"you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.","book 1"
"The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just","book 1"
"brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back","book 1"
"into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look","book 1"
"at them all.","book 1"
"“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey.","book 1"
"…”","book 1"
"He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.","book 1"
"“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.","book 1"
"Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,","book 1"
"terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.","book 1"
"“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.","book 1"
"Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the","book 1"
"beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.","book 1"
"“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a","book 1"
"lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.”","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.","book 1"
"“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and","book 1"
"entering!”","book 1"
"“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached over","book 1"
"the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a","book 1"
"knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the","book 1"
"room.","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.","book 1"
"“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a","book 1"
"very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at","book 1"
"some point, but it’ll taste all right.”","book 1"
"From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed","book 1"
"box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate","book 1"
"cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.","book 1"
"Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words","book 1"
"got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”","book 1"
"The giant chuckled.","book 1"
"“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and","book 1"
"Grounds at Hogwarts.”","book 1"
"He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.","book 1"
"“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d","book 1"
"not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”","book 1"
"His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he","book 1"
"snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing","book 1"
"but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the","book 1"
"whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him","book 1"
"as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.","book 1"
"The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and","book 1"
"began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a","book 1"
"squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a","book 1"
"bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea.","book 1"
"Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a","book 1"
"thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly","book 1"
"burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said","book 1"
"sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”","book 1"
"The giant chuckled darkly.","book 1"
"“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’","book 1"
"worry.”","book 1"
"He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted","book 1"
"anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as","book 1"
"nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t","book 1"
"really know who you are.”","book 1"
"The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his","book 1"
"hand.","book 1"
"“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m","book 1"
"Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.","book 1"
"“Er — no,” said Harry.","book 1"
"Hagrid looked shocked.","book 1"
"“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.","book 1"
"“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank","book 1"
"back into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’","book 1"
"yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer","book 1"
"cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?”","book 1"
"“All what?” asked Harry.","book 1"
"“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!”","book 1"
"He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The","book 1"
"Dursleys were cowering against the wall.","book 1"
"“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this boy —","book 1"
"this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?”","book 1"
"Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all,","book 1"
"and his marks weren’t bad.","book 1"
"“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff.”","book 1"
"But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean.","book 1"
"Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.”","book 1"
"“What world?”","book 1"
"Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.","book 1"
"“DURSLEY!” he boomed.","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that","book 1"
"sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.","book 1"
"“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re","book 1"
"famous. You’re famous.”","book 1"
"“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?”","book 1"
"“Yeh don’ know...yeh don’ know....” Hagrid ran his fingers through his","book 1"
"hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.","book 1"
"“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.","book 1"
"“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy","book 1"
"anything!”","book 1"
"A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious","book 1"
"look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with","book 1"
"rage.","book 1"
"“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore","book 1"
"left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it","book 1"
"from him all these years?”","book 1"
"“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.","book 1"
"“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.","book 1"
"Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.","book 1"
"“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a","book 1"
"wizard.”","book 1"
"There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind","book 1"
"could be heard.","book 1"
"“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.","book 1"
"“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which","book 1"
"groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good ‘un, I’d say, once yeh’ve","book 1"
"been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be?","book 1"
"An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”","book 1"
"Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,","book 1"
"addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The","book 1"
"Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:","book 1"
"HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY","book 1"
"Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE","book 1"
"(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme","book 1"
"Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)","book 1"
"Dear Mr. Potter,","book 1"
"We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts","book 1"
"School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary","book 1"
"books and equipment.","book 1"
"Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.","book 1"
"Yours sincerely,","book 1"
"Minerva McGonagall,","book 1"
"Deputy Headmistress","book 1"
"Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t","book 1"
"decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it","book 1"
"mean, they await my owl?”","book 1"
"“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to","book 1"
"his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another","book 1"
"pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking","book 1"
"owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth","book 1"
"he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:","book 1"
"Dear Professor Dumbledore,","book 1"
"Given Harry his letter.","book 1"
"Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.","book 1"
"Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.","book 1"
"Hagrid","book 1"
"Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak,","book 1"
"went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and","book 1"
"sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.","book 1"
"Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.","book 1"
"“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still","book 1"
"ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.","book 1"
"“He’s not going,” he said.","book 1"
"Hagrid grunted.","book 1"
"“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.","book 1"
"“A what?” said Harry, interested.","book 1"
"“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them.","book 1"
"An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid","book 1"
"eyes on.”","book 1"
"“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!”","book 1"
"“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a wizard?”","book 1"
"“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we knew!","book 1"
"How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter","book 1"
"just like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every","book 1"
"vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the","book 1"
"only one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother and","book 1"
"father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in","book 1"
"the family!”","book 1"
"She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed","book 1"
"she had been wanting to say all this for years.","book 1"
"“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had","book 1"
"you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as — as —","book 1"
"abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we","book 1"
"got landed with you!”","book 1"
"Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said,","book 1"
"“Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!”","book 1"
"“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys","book 1"
"scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter?","book 1"
"It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every","book 1"
"kid in our world knows his name!”","book 1"
"“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.","book 1"
"The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious.","book 1"
"“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea,","book 1"
"when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much","book 1"
"yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh —","book 1"
"but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”","book 1"
"He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.","book 1"
"“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell","book 1"
"yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it.…”","book 1"
"He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It","book 1"
"begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t","book 1"
"know his name, everyone in our world knows —”","book 1"
"“Who?”","book 1"
"“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”","book 1"
"“Why not?”","book 1"
"“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult.","book 1"
"See, there was this wizard who went ...bad. As bad as you could go. Worse.","book 1"
"Worse than worse. His name was...”","book 1"
"Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.","book 1"
"“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.","book 1"
"“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort. ” Hagrid shuddered. “Don’","book 1"
"make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now,","book 1"
"started lookin’ fer followers. Got ‘em, too — some were afraid, some just","book 1"
"wanted a bit o’ his power, ‘cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark","book 1"
"days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange","book 1"
"wizards or witches…terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ‘Course, some","book 1"
"stood up to him — an’ he killed ‘em. Horribly. One o’ the only safe places left","book 1"
"was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid","book 1"
"of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.","book 1"
"“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew.","book 1"
"Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-","book 1"
"Know-Who never tried to get ‘em on his side before…probably knew they were","book 1"
"too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.","book 1"
"“Maybe he thought he could persuade ‘em...maybe he just wanted ‘em","book 1"
"outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all","book 1"
"living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer","book 1"
"house an’ — an’ —”","book 1"
"Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew","book 1"
"his nose with a sound like a foghorn.","book 1"
"“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer","book 1"
"people yeh couldn’t find — anyway….","book 1"
"“You-Know-Who killed ‘em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of","book 1"
"the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose,","book 1"
"or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered","book 1"
"how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what","book 1"
"yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad","book 1"
"an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous,","book 1"
"Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one except you, an’","book 1"
"he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons,","book 1"
"the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.”","book 1"
"Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story","book 1"
"came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than","book 1"
"he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the","book 1"
"first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.","book 1"
"Hagrid was watching him sadly.","book 1"
"“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders.","book 1"
"Brought yeh ter this lot….”","book 1"
"“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost","book 1"
"forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have","book 1"
"got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.","book 1"
"“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something","book 1"
"strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and","book 1"
"as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and","book 1"
"the world’s better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got,","book 1"
"getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always","book 1"
"knew they’d come to a sticky end —”","book 1"
"But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink","book 1"
"umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he","book 1"
"said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word….”","book 1"
"In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant,","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and","book 1"
"fell silent.","book 1"
"“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on","book 1"
"the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.","book 1"
"Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.","book 1"
"“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?”","book 1"
"“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter","book 1"
"kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see…he was","book 1"
"gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?","book 1"
"“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough","book 1"
"human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I","book 1"
"don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ‘em","book 1"
"came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’","book 1"
"back.","book 1"
"“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers.","book 1"
"Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There","book 1"
"was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — I dunno what it was,","book 1"
"no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.”","book 1"
"Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but","book 1"
"Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a","book 1"
"horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his life","book 1"
"being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he","book 1"
"was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time","book 1"
"they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest","book 1"
"sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him","book 1"
"around like a football?","book 1"
"“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t","book 1"
"think I can be a wizard.”","book 1"
"To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.","book 1"
"“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or","book 1"
"angry?”","book 1"
"Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it…every odd","book 1"
"thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when","book 1"
"he, Harry, had been upset or angry…chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow","book 1"
"found himself out of their reach…dreading going to school with that ridiculous","book 1"
"haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had","book 1"
"hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it?","book 1"
"Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?","book 1"
"Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively","book 1"
"beaming at him.","book 1"
"“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be","book 1"
"right famous at Hogwarts.”","book 1"
"But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.","book 1"
"“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall","book 1"
"High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of","book 1"
"rubbish — spell books and wands and —”","book 1"
"“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled","book 1"
"Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His","book 1"
"name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of","book 1"
"witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know","book 1"
"himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under","book 1"
"the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled—”","book 1"
"“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO","book 1"
"TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.","book 1"
"But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it","book 1"
"over his head, “NEVER —” he thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS —","book 1"
"DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!”","book 1"
"He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at","book 1"
"Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp","book 1"
"squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands","book 1"
"clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them,","book 1"
"Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.","book 1"
"Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other","book 1"
"room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind","book 1"
"them.","book 1"
"Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.","book 1"
"“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work","book 1"
"anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig","book 1"
"anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.”","book 1"
"He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.","book 1"
"“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” he said.","book 1"
"“I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a","book 1"
"bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so","book 1"
"keen ter take on the job.”","book 1"
"“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.","book 1"
"“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell","book 1"
"yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ everything.","book 1"
"But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.”","book 1"
"“Why were you expelled?”","book 1"
"“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly.","book 1"
"“Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.”","book 1"
"He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.","book 1"
"“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think","book 1"
"I still got a couple o’ doormice in one o’ the pockets.”","book 1"
"The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the Riddle","book 2"
"House,” even though it had been many years since the Riddle","book 2"
"family had lived there. It stood on a hill overlooking the village,","book 2"
"some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy","book 2"
"spreading unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor, and","book 2"
"easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle","book 2"
"House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.","book 2"
"The Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house was “creepy.”","book 2"
"Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened","book 2"
"there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked","book 2"
"to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce. The story had been","book 2"
"picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many","book 2"
"places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.","book 2"
"Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty","book 2"
"years before, at daybreak on a fine summer’s morning, when the","book 2"
"Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had","book 2"
"entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.","book 2"
"The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and","book 2"
"roused as many people as she could.","book 2"
"“Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their","book 2"
"dinner things!”","book 2"
"The police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton","book 2"
"had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement.","book 2"
"Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the","book 2"
"Riddles, for they had been most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs.","book 2"
"Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son,","book 2"
"Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All the villagers cared about was","book 2"
"the identity of their murderer — for plainly, three apparently","book 2"
"healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same","book 2"
"night.","book 2"
"The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that","book 2"

"murders. They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the","book 2"
"Riddles’ cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced","book 2"
"to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just","book 2"
"been arrested.","book 2"
"“Frank!” cried several people. “Never!”","book 2"
"Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone in a rundown","book 2"
"cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had","book 2"
"come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of","book 2"
"crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever","book 2"
"since.","book 2"
"There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.","book 2"
"“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers,","book 2"
"after her fourth sherry. “Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered","book 2"
"him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never","book 2"
"wanted to mix, he didn’t.”","book 2"
"“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar, “he had a hard war, Frank.","book 2"
"He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to —”","book 2"
"“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.","book 2"
"“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back","book 2"
"as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken","book 2"
"windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while","book 2"
"we was all sleeping. . . .”","book 2"
"The villagers exchanged dark looks.","book 2"
"“I always thought he had a nasty look about him, right enough,”","book 2"
"grunted a man at the bar.","book 2"
"“War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the landlord.","book 2"
"“Told you I wouldn’t like to get on the wrong side of Frank,","book 2"
"didn’t I, Dot?” said an excited woman in the corner.","book 2"
"“Horrible temper,” said Dot, nodding fervently. “I remember,","book 2"
"when he was a kid . . .”","book 2"
"By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton","book 2"
"doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.","book 2"
"But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the","book 2"
"dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating,","book 2"
"again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he","book 2"
"had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been","book 2"
"a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale. Nobody else in the","book 2"
"village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure that","book 2"
"Frank had invented him.","book 2"
"Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the","book 2"
"report on the Riddles’ bodies came back and changed everything.","book 2"
"The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors","book 2"
"had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles","book 2"
"had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as","book 2"
"far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued,","book 2"
"in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared","book 2"
"to be in perfect health — apart from the fact that they were all","book 2"
"dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something","book 2"
"wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of","book 2"
"terror upon his or her face — but as the frustrated police said,","book 2"
"whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?","book 2"
"As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all,","book 2"
"the police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in","book 2"
"the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects","book 2"
"of curiosity for a while. To everyone’s surprise, and amid a cloud of","book 2"
"suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the","book 2"
"Riddle House.","book 2"
"“ ’S far as I’m concerned, he killed them, and I don’t care what","book 2"
"the police say,” said Dot in the Hanged Man. “And if he had any","book 2"
"decency, he’d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.”","book 2"
"But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the","book 2"
"next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next —","book 2"
"for neither family stayed long. Perhaps it was partly because of","book 2"
"Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the","book 2"
"place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into","book 2"
"disrepair.","book 2"
"The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither","book 2"
"lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept","book 2"
"it for “tax reasons,” though nobody was very clear what these might","book 2"
"be. The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening,","book 2"
"however. Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now,","book 2"
"very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering","book 2"
"around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were","book 2"
"starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.","book 2"
"Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either.","book 2"
"Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones","book 2"
"through the windows of the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles","book 2"
"over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or","book 2"
"twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that old","book 2"
"Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an","book 2"
"obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden,","book 2"
"brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for","book 2"
"his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their","book 2"
"parents and grandparents, thought him a murderer. So when Frank","book 2"
"awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the","book 2"
"old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further","book 2"
"in their attempts to punish him.","book 2"
"It was Frank’s bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse","book 2"
"than ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the","book 2"
"kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the","book 2"
"stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he","book 2"
"looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper","book 2"
"windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys","book 2"
"had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering","book 2"
"quality of the light, they had started a fire.","book 2"
"Frank had no telephone, and in any case, he had deeply mistrusted","book 2"
"the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning","book 2"
"about the Riddles’ deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried","book 2"
"back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back","book 2"
"in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its","book 2"
"hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was","book 2"
"propped against the wall, and set off into the night.","book 2"
"The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being","book 2"
"forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the","book 2"
"back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden","book 2"
"by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened","book 2"
"the door noiselessly.","book 2"
"He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered","book 2"
"it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he","book 2"
"remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his","book 2"
"way toward it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for","book 2"
"any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the","book 2"
"hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows","book 2"
"on either side of the front door, and started to climb the","book 2"
"stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it","book 2"
"muffled the sound of his feet and stick.","book 2"
"On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the","book 2"
"intruders were: At the very end of the passage a door stood ajar, and","book 2"
"a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of","book 2"
"gold across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, grasping","book 2"
"his walking stick firmly. Several feet from the entrance, he was able","book 2"
"to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.","book 2"
"The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised","book 2"
"him. Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man’s","book 2"
"voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.","book 2"
"“There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still","book 2"
"hungry.”","book 2"
"“Later,” said a second voice. This too belonged to a man — but","book 2"
"it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy","book 2"
"wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the","book 2"
"back of Frank’s neck stand up. “Move me closer to the fire,","book 2"
"Wormtail.”","book 2"
"Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear.","book 2"
"There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard","book 2"
"surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being","book 2"
"dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his","book 2"
"back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a","book 2"
"long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head.","book 2"
"Then he went out of sight again.","book 2"
"“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice.","book 2"
"“I — I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice nervously. “She","book 2"
"set out to explore the house, I think. . . .”","book 2"
"“You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,” said the second","book 2"
"voice. “I will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me","book 2"
"greatly.”","book 2"
"Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the","book 2"
"door, listening very hard. There was a pause, and then the man","book 2"
"called Wormtail spoke again.","book 2"
"“My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?”","book 2"
"“A week,” said the cold voice. “Perhaps longer. The place is moderately","book 2"
"comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be","book 2"
"foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.”","book 2"
"Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing,","book 2"
"no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word","book 2"
"“Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.","book 2"
"“The — the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said Wormtail.","book 2"
"(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.) “Forgive","book 2"
"me, but — I do not understand — why should we wait until the","book 2"
"World Cup is over?”","book 2"
"“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the","book 2"
"country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry","book 2"
"of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity,","book 2"
"checking and double-checking identities. They will be","book 2"
"obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we","book 2"
"wait.”","book 2"
"Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard","book 2"
"the words “Ministry of Magic,” “wizards,” and “Muggles.” Plainly,","book 2"
"each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could","book 2"
"think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies","book 2"
"and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once","book 2"
"more, and listened more closely still.","book 2"
"“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.","book 2"
"“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of","book 2"
"menace in the cold voice now.","book 2"
"A slight pause followed — and then Wormtail spoke, the words","book 2"
"tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to","book 2"
"say this before he lost his nerve.","book 2"
"“It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.”","book 2"
"Another pause, more protracted, and then —","book 2"
"“Without Harry Potter?” breathed the second voice softly. “I","book 2"
"see . . .”","book 2"
"“My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!” said","book 2"
"Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. “The boy is nothing to me,","book 2"
"nothing at all! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or","book 2"
"wizard — any wizard — the thing could be done so much more","book 2"
"quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while — you","book 2"
"know that I can disguise myself most effectively — I could be back","book 2"
"here in as little as two days with a suitable person —”","book 2"
"“I could use another wizard,” said the cold voice softly, “that is","book 2"
"true. . . .”","book 2"
"“My Lord, it makes sense,” said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly","book 2"
"relieved now. “Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult,","book 2"
"he is so well protected —”","book 2"
"“And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I wonder","book 2"
". . . perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for","book 2"
"you, “Wormtail? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be","book 2"
"nothing more than an attempt to desert me?”","book 2"
"“My Lord! I — I have no wish to leave you, none at all —”","book 2"
"“Do not lie to me!” hissed the second voice. “I can always tell,","book 2"
"Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt","book 2"
"you. I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when","book 2"
"you touch me. . . .”","book 2"
"“No! My devotion to Your Lordship —”","book 2"
"“Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not","book 2"
"be here if you had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without","book 2"
"you, when I need feeding every few hours? Who is to milk","book 2"
"Nagini?”","book 2"
"“But you seem so much stronger, My Lord —”","book 2"
"“Liar,” breathed the second voice. “I am no stronger, and a few","book 2"
"days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained","book 2"
"under your clumsy care. Silence!”","book 2"
"Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at","book 2"
"once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire","book 2"
"crackling. Then the second man spoke once more, in a whisper","book 2"
"that was almost a hiss.","book 2"
"“I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained","book 2"
"to you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few","book 2"
"more months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding","book 2"
"the boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is","book 2"
"needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail — courage you will","book 2"
"find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldemort’s","book 2"
"wrath —”","book 2"
"“My Lord, I must speak!” said Wormtail, panic in his voice now.","book 2"
"“All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head —","book 2"
"My Lord, Bertha Jorkins’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for","book 2"
"long, and if we proceed, if I murder —”","book 2"
"“If?” whispered the second voice. “If ? If you follow the plan,","book 2"
"Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died.","book 2"
"You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that I could do","book 2"
"it myself, but in my present condition . . . Come, Wormtail, one","book 2"
"more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not asking","book 2"
"you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful servant will have rejoined","book 2"
"us —”","book 2"
"“I am a faithful servant,” said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness","book 2"
"in his voice.","book 2"
"“Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty","book 2"
"has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither","book 2"
"requirement.”","book 2"
"“I found you,” said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky","book 2"
"edge to his voice now. “I was the one who found you. I brought","book 2"
"you Bertha Jorkins.”","book 2"
"“That is true,” said the second man, sounding amused. “A stroke","book 2"
"of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail","book 2"
"— though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she","book 2"
"would be when you caught her, were you?”","book 2"
"“I — I thought she might be useful, My Lord —”","book 2"
"“Liar,” said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more","book 2"
"pronounced than ever. “However, I do not deny that her information","book 2"
"was invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our","book 2"
"plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will allow","book 2"
"you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my","book 2"
"followers would give their right hands to perform. . . .”","book 2"
"“R-really, My Lord? What — ?” Wormtail sounded terrified","book 2"
"again.","book 2"
"“Ah, Wormtail, you don’t want me to spoil the surprise? Your","book 2"
"part will come at the very end . . . but I promise you, you will have","book 2"
"the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins.”","book 2"
"“You . . . you . . .” Wormtail’s voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as","book 2"
"though his mouth had gone very dry. “You . . . are going . . . to kill","book 2"
"me too?”","book 2"
"“Wormtail, Wormtail,” said the cold voice silkily, “why would I","book 2"
"kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after","book 2"
"my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions","book 2"
"would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with","book 2"
"the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are","book 2"
"supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of","book 2"
"Magic witches at wayside inns. . . .”","book 2"
"Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not","book 2"
"hear it, but it made the second man laugh — an entirely mirthless","book 2"
"laugh, cold as his speech.","book 2"
"“We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can","book 2"
"be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her.","book 2"
"It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted","book 2"
"from her, Wormtail.”","book 2"
"Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand","book 2"
"gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with","book 2"
"the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without","book 2"
"any kind of remorse — with amusement. He was dangerous — a","book 2"
"madman. And he was planning more murders — this boy, Harry","book 2"
"Potter, whoever he was — was in danger —","book 2"
"Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to","book 2"
"the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for","book 2"
"the telephone box in the village . . . but the cold voice was speaking","book 2"
"again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening","book 2"
"with all his might.","book 2"
"“One more murder . . . my faithful servant at Hogwarts . . .","book 2"
"Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will","book 2"
"be no more argument. But quiet . . . I think I hear Nagini. . . .”","book 2"
"And the second man’s voice changed. He started making noises","book 2"
"such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting","book 2"
"without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some","book 2"
"sort of fit or seizure.","book 2"
"And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway.","book 2"
"He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with","book 2"
"fright.","book 2"
"Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor","book 2"
"floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with","book 2"
"a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet","book 2"
"long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut","book 2"
"a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming","book 2"
"closer and closer — What was he to do? The only means of escape","book 2"
"was into the room where two men sat plotting murder, yet if he","book 2"
"stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him —","book 2"
"But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with","book 2"
"him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following","book 2"
"the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond","book 2"
"the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had","book 2"
"vanished through the gap.","book 2"
"There was sweat on Frank’s forehead now, and the hand on the","book 2"
"walking stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was","book 2"
"continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible","book 2"
"idea. . . . This man could talk to snakes.","book 2"
"Frank didn’t understand what was going on. He wanted more","book 2"
"than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The","book 2"
"problem was that his legs didn’t seem to want to move. As he stood","book 2"
"there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched","book 2"
"abruptly to English again.","book 2"
"“Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,” it said.","book 2"
"“In-indeed, My Lord?” said Wormtail.","book 2"
"“Indeed, yes,” said the voice. “According to Nagini, there is an","book 2"
"old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every","book 2"
"word we say.”","book 2"
"Frank didn’t have a chance to hide himself. There were footsteps,","book 2"
"and then the door of the room was flung wide open.","book 2"
"A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and","book 2"
"small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm","book 2"
"in his face.","book 2"
"“Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners?”","book 2"
"The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the","book 2"
"fire, but Frank couldn’t see the speaker. The snake, on the other","book 2"
"hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible","book 2"
"travesty of a pet dog.","book 2"
"Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply","book 2"
"shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped","book 2"
"over the threshold.","book 2"
"The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long,","book 2"
"spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the","book 2"
"armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant,","book 2"
"for Frank couldn’t even see the back of his head.","book 2"
"“You heard everything, Muggle?” said the cold voice.","book 2"
"“What’s that you’re calling me?” said Frank defiantly, for now","book 2"
"that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some","book 2"
"sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.","book 2"
"“I am calling you a Muggle,” said the voice coolly. “It means that","book 2"
"you are not a wizard.”","book 2"
"“I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank, his voice","book 2"
"growing steadier. “All I know is I’ve heard enough to interest the","book 2"
"police tonight, I have. You’ve done murder and you’re planning","book 2"
"more! And I’ll tell you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration,","book 2"
"“my wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back —”","book 2"
"“You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly. “Nobody","book 2"
"knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do","book 2"
"not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows . . . he always","book 2"
"knows. . . .”","book 2"
"“Is that right?” said Frank roughly. “Lord, is it? Well, I don’t","book 2"
"think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn ’round and face me","book 2"
"like a man, why don’t you?”","book 2"
"“But I am not a man, Muggle,” said the cold voice, barely audible","book 2"
"now over the crackling of the flames. “I am much, much more","book 2"
"than a man. However . . . why not? I will face you. . . . Wormtail,","book 2"
"come turn my chair around.”","book 2"
"The servant gave a whimper.","book 2"
"“You heard me, Wormtail.”","book 2"
"Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have","book 2"
"done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where","book 2"
"the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the","book 2"
"chair. The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as","book 2"
"the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.","book 2"
"And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting","book 2"
"in it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He","book 2"
"opened his mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so","book 2"
"loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as","book 2"
"it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound,","book 2"
"and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.","book 2"
"Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with","book 2"
"a start.","book 2"
"THE SCAR","book 2"
"Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had","book 2"
"been running. He had awoken from a vivid dream with","book 2"
"his hands pressed over his face. The old scar on his forehead, which","book 2"
"was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers","book 2"
"as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.","book 2"
"He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in","book 2"
"the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He","book 2"
"put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint,","book 2"
"misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the","book 2"
"street lamp outside the window.","book 2"
"Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He","book 2"
"turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the","book 2"
"room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside","book 2"
"of the door. A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his","book 2"
"bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He examined","book 2"
"the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely. It looked","book 2"
"normal, but it was still stinging.","book 2"
"Harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he","book 2"
"had awoken. It had seemed so real. . . . There had been two people","book 2"
"he knew and one he didn’t. . . . He concentrated hard, frowning,","book 2"
"trying to remember. . . .","book 2"
"The dim picture of a darkened room came to him. . . . There","book 2"
"had been a snake on a hearth rug . . . a small man called Peter,","book 2"
"nicknamed Wormtail . . . and a cold, high voice . . . the voice of","book 2"
"Lord Voldemort. Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped","book 2"
"down into his stomach at the very thought. . . .","book 2"
"He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort","book 2"
"had looked like, but it was impossible. . . . All Harry knew","book 2"
"was that at the moment when Voldemort’s chair had swung","book 2"
"around, and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt","book 2"
"a spasm of horror, which had awoken him . . . or had that been the","book 2"
"pain in his scar?","book 2"
"And who had the old man been? For there had definitely been an","book 2"
"old man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground. It was all becoming","book 2"
"confused. Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out","book 2"
"his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit","book 2"
"room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the","book 2"
"details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to","book 2"
"them. . . . Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone","book 2"
"they had killed, though Harry could not remember the","book 2"
"name . . . and they had been plotting to kill someone else . . . him!","book 2"
"Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared","book 2"
"around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual","book 2"
"there. As it happened, there were an extraordinary number of unusual","book 2"
"things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open at the","book 2"
"foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and","book 2"
"assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered that part of his","book 2"
"desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his","book 2"
"snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor beside his bed a","book 2"
"book lay open; Harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last","book 2"
"night. The pictures in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange","book 2"
"robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks,","book 2"
"throwing a red ball to one another.","book 2"
"Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched one","book 2"
"of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through","book 2"
"a fifty-foot-high hoop. Then he snapped the book shut. Even","book 2"
"Quidditch — in Harry’s opinion, the best sport in the world —","book 2"
"couldn’t distract him at the moment. He placed Flying with the","book 2"
"Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew","book 2"
"back the curtains to survey the street below.","book 2"
"Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street","book 2"
"would be expected to look in the early hours of Saturday morning.","book 2"
"All the curtains were closed. As far as Harry could see through the","book 2"
"darkness, there wasn’t a living creature in sight, not even a cat.","book 2"
"And yet . . . and yet . . . Harry went restlessly back to the bed","book 2"
"and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn’t","book 2"
"the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury.","book 2"
"He had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had","book 2"
"them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been pierced","book 2"
"by a venomous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last year","book 2"
"Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick. He was","book 2"
"used to bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you","book 2"
"attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a","book 2"
"knack for attracting a lot of trouble.","book 2"
"No, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the last time his","book 2"
"scar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close","book 2"
"by. . . . But Voldemort couldn’t be here, now. . . . The idea of","book 2"
"Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible. . . .","book 2"
"Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he halfexpecting","book 2"
"to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And","book 2"
"then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a","book 2"
"tremendous grunting snore from the next room.","book 2"
"Harry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. There was","book 2"
"no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia,","book 2"
"and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled","book 2"
"and painless.","book 2"
"Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn’t as","book 2"
"though they were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt","book 2"
"Petunia, and Dudley were Harry’s only living relatives. They were","book 2"
"Muggles who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant","book 2"
"that Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot. They","book 2"
"had explained away Harry’s long absences at Hogwarts over the last","book 2"
"three years by telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus’s Secure","book 2"
"Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew perfectly well","book 2"
"that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn’t allowed to use magic outside","book 2"
"Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything","book 2"
"that went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to","book 2"
"confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding","book 2"
"world. The very idea of going to them when they awoke, and","book 2"
"telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries","book 2"
"about Voldemort, was laughable.","book 2"
"And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live","book 2"
"with the Dursleys in the first place. If it hadn’t been for Voldemort,","book 2"
"Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it","book 2"
"hadn’t been for Voldemort, Harry would still have had parents. . . .","book 2"
"Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort — the most","book 2"
"powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining","book 2"
"power steadily for eleven years — arrived at his house and","book 2"
"killed his father and mother. Voldemort had then turned his wand","book 2"
"on Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many","book 2"
"full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power — and,","book 2"
"incredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the","book 2"
"curse had rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with","book 2"
"nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and Voldemort","book 2"
"had been reduced to something barely alive. His powers gone,","book 2"
"his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in","book 2"
"which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for","book 2"
"so long had lifted, Voldemort’s followers had disbanded, and Harry","book 2"
"Potter had become famous.","book 2"
"It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his","book 2"
"eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting","book 2"
"to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world","book 2"
"knew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads","book 2"
"turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was","book 2"
"used to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be starting his","book 2"
"fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days","book 2"
"until he would be back at the castle again.","book 2"
"But there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to","book 2"
"school. He looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye","book 2"
"paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at","book 2"
"the end of July. What would they say if Harry wrote to them and","book 2"
"told them about his scar hurting?","book 2"
"At once, Hermione Granger’s voice seemed to fill his head, shrill","book 2"
"and panicky.","book 2"
"“Your scar hurt? Harry, that’s really serious. . . . Write to Professor","book 2"
"Dumbledore! And I’ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and","book 2"
"Afflictions. . . . Maybe there’s something in there about curse scars. . . .”","book 2"
"Yes, that would be Hermione’s advice: Go straight to the headmaster","book 2"
"of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry","book 2"
"stared out of the window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted","book 2"
"very much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew,","book 2"
"he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort’s;","book 2"
"it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his","book 2"
"symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. As","book 2"
"for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore","book 2"
"went during the summer holidays. He amused himself for a","book 2"
"moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, fulllength","book 2"
"wizard’s robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach","book 2"
"somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose.","book 2"
"Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig","book 2"
"would be able to find him; Harry’s owl had never yet failed to deliver","book 2"
"a letter to anyone, even without an address. But what would","book 2"
"he write?","book 2"
"Dear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt","book 2"
"this morning. Yours sincerely, Harry Potter.","book 2"
"Even inside his head the words sounded stupid.","book 2"
"And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron Weasley’s,","book 2"
"reaction, and in a moment, Ron’s red hair and long-nosed, freckled","book 2"
"face seemed to swim before Harry, wearing a bemused expression.","book 2"
"“Your scar hurt? But . . . but You-Know-Who can’t be near you","book 2"
"now, can he? I mean . . . you’d know, wouldn’t you? He’d be trying to","book 2"
"do you in again, wouldn’t he? I dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always","book 2"
"twinge a bit. . . . I’ll ask Dad. . . .”","book 2"
"Mr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the","book 2"
"Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he","book 2"
"didn’t have any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as","book 2"
"Harry knew. In any case, Harry didn’t like the idea of the whole","book 2"
"Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about","book 2"
"a few moments’ pain. Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than","book 2"
"Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron’s sixteen-year-old twin","book 2"
"brothers, might think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys","book 2"
"were Harry’s favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they","book 2"
"might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something","book 2"
"about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn’t","book 2"
"want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.","book 2"
"Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really","book 2"
"wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was","book 2"
"someone like — someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice","book 2"
"he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about","book 2"
"him, who had had experience with Dark Magic. . . .","book 2"
"And then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious,","book 2"
"that he couldn’t believe it had taken so long — Sirius.","book 2"
"Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat","book 2"
"down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him,","book 2"
"loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then","book 2"
"paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling","book 2"
"at the fact that he hadn’t thought of Sirius straight away. But then,","book 2"
"perhaps it wasn’t so surprising — after all, he had only found out","book 2"
"that Sirius was his godfather two months ago.","book 2"
"There was a simple reason for Sirius’s complete absence from","book 2"
"Harry’s life until then — Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying","book 2"
"wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors, sightless, soulsucking","book 2"
"fiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts","book 2"
"when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent — the murders","book 2"
"for which he had been convicted had been committed by Wormtail,","book 2"
"Voldemort’s supporter, whom nearly everybody now believed","book 2"
"dead. Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they","book 2"
"had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year,","book 2"
"though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.","book 2"
"For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving","book 2"
"the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his","book 2"
"name had been cleared. But the chance had been snatched away","book 2"
"from him — Wormtail had escaped before they could take him to","book 2"
"the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life. Harry","book 2"
"had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak,","book 2"
"and since then, Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry might","book 2"
"have had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all","book 2"
"summer. It had been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing","book 2"
"that he had so nearly escaped them forever.","book 2"
"Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he","book 2"
"couldn’t be with him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all","book 2"
"his school things in his bedroom with him. The Dursleys had never","book 2"
"allowed this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable","book 2"
"as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them","book 2"
"to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every","book 2"
"summer prior to this. But their attitude had changed since they","book 2"
"had found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather","book 2"
"— for Harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that","book 2"
"Sirius was innocent.","book 2"
"Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been","book 2"
"back at Privet Drive. Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was","book 2"
"usual with wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds.","book 2"
"Hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders; she had been","book 2"
"most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before","book 2"
"flying off again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they put","book 2"
"him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that,","book 2"
"wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted),","book 2"
"he was enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to","book 2"
"imagine dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight; perhaps","book 2"
"that was why Sirius had gone south. Sirius’s letters, which were now","book 2"
"hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under Harry’s","book 2"
"bed, sounded cheerful, and in both of them he had reminded","book 2"
"Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to","book 2"
"now, all right. . . .","book 2"
"Harry’s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that","book 2"
"precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun","book 2"
"had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when","book 2"
"sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt","book 2"
"Petunia’s room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment","book 2"
"and reread his finished letter.","book 2"
"Dear Sirius,","book 2"
"Thanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it","book 2"
"could hardly get through my window.","book 2"
"Things are the same as usual here. Dudley’s diet isn’t going","book 2"
"too well. My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his","book 2"
"room yesterday. They told him they’d have to cut his pocket","book 2"
"money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked","book 2"
"his PlayStation out of the window. That’s a sort of computer","book 2"
"thing you can play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn’t","book 2"
"even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind off","book 2"
"things.","book 2"
"I’m okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you","book 2"
"might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.","book 2"
"A weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar","book 2"
"hurt again. Last time that happened it was because Voldemort","book 2"
"was at Hogwarts. But I don’t reckon he can be anywhere near","book 2"
"me now, can he? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt","book 2"
"years afterward ?","book 2"
"I’ll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she’s off hunting","book 2"
"at the moment. Say hello to Buckbeak for me.","book 2"
"Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point","book 2"
"putting in the dream; he didn’t want it to look as though he was too","book 2"
"worried. He folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk,","book 2"
"ready for when Hedwig returned. Then he got to his feet, stretched,","book 2"
"and opened his wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his reflection,","book 2"
"he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast.","book 2"
"THE INVITATION","book 2"
"By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys","book 2"
"were already seated around the table. None of them looked up","book 2"
"as he entered or sat down. Uncle Vernon’s large red face was hidden","book 2"
"behind the morning’s Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a","book 2"
"grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth.","book 2"
"Dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be","book 2"
"taking up even more space than usual. This was saying something,","book 2"
"as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself.","book 2"
"When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto","book 2"
"Dudley’s plate with a tremulous “There you are, Diddy darling,”","book 2"
"Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant turn","book 2"
"since he had come home for the summer with his end-of-year","book 2"
"report.","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses","book 2"
"for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley","book 2"
"was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn’t understand him,","book 2"
"while Uncle Vernon maintained that “he didn’t want some swotty","book 2"
"little nancy boy for a son anyway.” They also skated over the accusations","book 2"
"of bullying in the report — “He’s a boisterous little boy, but","book 2"
"he wouldn’t hurt a fly!” Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.","book 2"
"However, at the bottom of the report there were a few wellchosen","book 2"
"comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon","book 2"
"and Aunt Petunia could explain away. No matter how much","book 2"
"Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big-boned, and that his","book 2"
"poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who","book 2"
"needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters","book 2"
"didn’t stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore. The","book 2"
"school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia’s eyes — so sharp when it","book 2"
"came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing","book 2"
"the comings and goings of the neighbors — simply refused","book 2"
"to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had","book 2"
"reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.","book 2"
"So — after many tantrums, after arguments that shook Harry’s","book 2"
"bedroom floor, and many tears from Aunt Petunia — the new","book 2"
"regime had begun. The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings","book 2"
"school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been","book 2"
"emptied of all Dudley’s favorite things — fizzy drinks and cakes,","book 2"
"chocolate bars and burgers — and filled instead with fruit and vegetables","book 2"
"and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called “rabbit","book 2"
"food.” To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had","book 2"
"insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed","book 2"
"a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller","book 2"
"than Dudley’s. Aunt Petunia seemed to feel that the best way to","book 2"
"keep up Dudley’s morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get","book 2"
"more to eat than Harry.","book 2"
"But Aunt Petunia didn’t know what was hidden under the loose","book 2"
"floorboard upstairs. She had no idea that Harry was not following","book 2"
"the diet at all. The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was","book 2"
"expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, Harry had sent","book 2"
"Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they had risen to the","book 2"
"occasion magnificently. Hedwig had returned from Hermione’s","book 2"
"house with a large box stuffed full of sugar-free snacks. (Hermione’s","book 2"
"parents were dentists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had","book 2"
"obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes. (Harry","book 2"
"hadn’t touched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid’s","book 2"
"cooking.) Mrs. Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol,","book 2"
"with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who","book 2"
"was elderly and feeble, had needed a full five days to recover from","book 2"
"the journey. And then on Harry’s birthday (which the Dursleys had","book 2"
"completely ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes,","book 2"
"one each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Sirius. Harry still had","book 2"
"two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he","book 2"
"got back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint.","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval","book 2"
"and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter.","book 2"
"“Is this it?” he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.","book 2"
"Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly","book 2"
"at Dudley, who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and","book 2"
"was eyeing Harry’s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his large, bushy","book 2"
"mustache, and picked up his spoon.","book 2"
"The doorbell rang. Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair","book 2"
"and set off down the hall. Quick as a flash, while his mother was","book 2"
"occupied with the kettle, Dudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon’s","book 2"
"grapefruit.","book 2"
"Harry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon answering curtly. Then the front door closed, and","book 2"
"the sound of ripping paper came from the hall.","book 2"
"Aunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously","book 2"
"around to see where Uncle Vernon had got to. She didn’t have","book 2"
"to wait long to find out; after about a minute, he was back. He","book 2"
"looked livid.","book 2"
"“You,” he barked at Harry. “In the living room. Now.”","book 2"
"Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have","book 2"
"done this time, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the","book 2"
"kitchen and into the next room. Uncle Vernon closed the door","book 2"
"sharply behind both of them.","book 2"
"“So,” he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face","book 2"
"Harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest.","book 2"
"“So.”","book 2"
"Harry would have dearly loved to have said, “So what?” but he","book 2"
"didn’t feel that Uncle Vernon’s temper should be tested this early in","book 2"
"the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain","book 2"
"from lack of food. He therefore settled for looking politely puzzled.","book 2"
"“This just arrived,” said Uncle Vernon. He brandished a piece of","book 2"
"purple writing paper at Harry. “A letter. About you.”","book 2"
"Harry’s confusion increased. Who would be writing to Uncle","book 2"
"Vernon about him? Who did he know who sent letters by the","book 2"
"postman?","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at the letter","book 2"
"and began to read aloud:","book 2"
"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,","book 2"
"We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have","book 2"
"heard a great deal from Harry about my son Ron.","book 2"
"As Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch","book 2"
"World Cup takes place this Monday night, and my husband,","book 2"
"Arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections","book 2"
"at the Department of Magical Games and Sports.","book 2"
"I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as","book 2"
"this really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; Britain hasn’t","book 2"
"hosted the cup for thirty years, and tickets are extremely hard","book 2"
"to come by. We would of course be glad to have Harry stay for","book 2"
"the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him safely","book 2"
"onto the train back to school.","book 2"
"It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly","book 2"
"as possible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has","book 2"
"never delivered to our house, and I am not sure he even knows","book 2"
"where it is.","book 2"
"Hoping to see Harry soon,","book 2"
"Yours sincerely,","book 2"
"P.S. I do hope we’ve put enough stamps on.","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast","book 2"
"pocket, and drew out something else.","book 2"
"“Look at this,” he growled.","book 2"
"He held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley’s letter had","book 2"
"come, and Harry had to fight down a laugh. Every bit of it was","book 2"
"covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into","book 2"
"which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys’ address in minute","book 2"
"writing.","book 2"
"“She did put enough stamps on, then,” said Harry, trying to","book 2"
"sound as though Mrs. Weasley’s was a mistake anyone could make.","book 2"
"His uncle’s eyes flashed.","book 2"
"“The postman noticed,” he said through gritted teeth. “Very interested","book 2"
"to know where this letter came from, he was. That’s why he","book 2"
"rang the doorbell. Seemed to think it was funny.”","book 2"
"Harry didn’t say anything. Other people might not understand","book 2"
"why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps, but","book 2"
"Harry had lived with the Dursleys too long not to know how","book 2"
"touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary.","book 2"
"Their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were","book 2"
"connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs. Weasley.","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his expression","book 2"
"neutral. If he didn’t do or say anything stupid, he might","book 2"
"just be in for the treat of a lifetime. He waited for Uncle Vernon to","book 2"
"say something, but he merely continued to glare. Harry decided to","book 2"
"break the silence.","book 2"
"“So — can I go then?” he asked.","book 2"
"A slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon’s large purple face. The","book 2"
"mustache bristled. Harry thought he knew what was going on behind","book 2"
"the mustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon’s most","book 2"
"fundamental instincts came into conflict. Allowing Harry to go","book 2"
"would make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled","book 2"
"against for thirteen years. On the other hand, allowing Harry to","book 2"
"disappear to the Weasleys’ for the rest of the summer would get rid","book 2"
"of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house. To give himself","book 2"
"thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at Mrs. Weasley’s letter","book 2"
"again.","book 2"
"“Who is this woman?” he said, staring at the signature with","book 2"
"distaste.","book 2"
"“You’ve seen her,” said Harry. “She’s my friend Ron’s mother, she","book 2"
"was meeting him off the Hog — off the school train at the end of","book 2"
"last term.”","book 2"
"He had almost said “Hogwarts Express,” and that was a sure way","book 2"
"to get his uncle’s temper up. Nobody ever mentioned the name of","book 2"
"Harry’s school aloud in the Dursley household.","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to","book 2"
"remember something very unpleasant.","book 2"
"“Dumpy sort of woman?” he growled finally. “Load of children","book 2"
"with red hair?”","book 2"
"Harry frowned. He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to","book 2"
"call anyone “dumpy,” when his own son, Dudley, had finally","book 2"
"achieved what he’d been threatening to do since the age of three,","book 2"
"and become wider than he was tall.","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.","book 2"
"“Quidditch,” he muttered under his breath. “Quidditch — what","book 2"
"is this rubbish?”","book 2"
"Harry felt a second stab of annoyance.","book 2"
"“It’s a sport,” he said shortly. “Played on broom —”","book 2"
"“All right, all right!” said Uncle Vernon loudly. Harry saw, with","book 2"
"some satisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky. Apparently","book 2"
"his nerves couldn’t stand the sound of the word “broomsticks”","book 2"
"in his living room. He took refuge in perusing the letter","book 2"
"again. Harry saw his lips form the words “send us your answer . . .","book 2"
"in the normal way.” He scowled.","book 2"
"“What does she mean, ‘the normal way’?” he spat.","book 2"
"“Normal for us,” said Harry, and before his uncle could stop","book 2"
"him, he added, “you know, owl post. That’s what’s normal for","book 2"
"wizards.”","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a","book 2"
"disgusting swear word. Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look","book 2"
"through the window, as though expecting to see some of the neighbors","book 2"
"with their ears pressed against the glass.","book 2"
"“How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness","book 2"
"under my roof?” he hissed, his face now a rich plum","book 2"
"color. “You stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on","book 2"
"your ungrateful back —”","book 2"
"“Only after Dudley finished with them,” said Harry coldly, and","book 2"
"indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had","book 2"
"had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his","book 2"
"hands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.","book 2"
"“I will not be spoken to like that!” said Uncle Vernon, trembling","book 2"
"with rage.","book 2"
"But Harry wasn’t going to stand for this. Gone were the days","book 2"
"when he had been forced to take every single one of the Dursleys’","book 2"
"stupid rules. He wasn’t following Dudley’s diet, and he wasn’t going","book 2"
"to let Uncle Vernon stop him from going to the Quidditch World","book 2"
"Cup, not if he could help it. Harry took a deep, steadying breath","book 2"
"and then said, “Okay, I can’t see the World Cup. Can I go now,","book 2"
"then? Only I’ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know —","book 2"
"my godfather.”","book 2"
"He had done it. He had said the magic words. Now he watched","book 2"
"the purple recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon’s face, making it","book 2"
"look like badly mixed black currant ice cream.","book 2"
"“You’re — you’re writing to him, are you?” said Uncle Vernon,","book 2"
"in a would-be calm voice — but Harry had seen the pupils of his","book 2"
"tiny eyes contract with sudden fear.","book 2"
"“Well — yeah,” said Harry, casually. “It’s been a while since he","book 2"
"heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn’t, he might start thinking","book 2"
"something’s wrong.”","book 2"
"He stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words. He could almost","book 2"
"see the cogs working under Uncle Vernon’s thick, dark, neatly","book 2"
"parted hair. If he tried to stop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would","book 2"
"think Harry was being mistreated. If he told Harry he couldn’t go","book 2"
"to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell Sirius,","book 2"
"who would know Harry was being mistreated. There was only one","book 2"
"thing for Uncle Vernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion","book 2"
"forming in his uncle’s mind as though the great mustached face","book 2"
"were transparent. Harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as","book 2"
"blank as possible. And then —","book 2"
"“Well, all right then. You can go to this ruddy . . . this stupid . . .","book 2"
"this World Cup thing. You write and tell these — these Weasleys","book 2"
"they’re to pick you up, mind. I haven’t got time to go dropping you","book 2"
"off all over the country. And you can spend the rest of the summer","book 2"
"there. And you can tell your — your godfather . . . tell him . . . tell","book 2"
"him you’re going.”","book 2"
"“Okay then,” said Harry brightly.","book 2"
"He turned and walked toward the living room door, fighting the","book 2"
"urge to jump into the air and whoop. He was going . . . he was","book 2"
"going to the Weasleys’, he was going to watch the Quidditch World","book 2"
"Cup!","book 2"
"Outside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been","book 2"
"lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being","book 2"
"told off. He looked shocked to see the broad grin on Harry’s","book 2"
"face.","book 2"
"“That was an excellent breakfast, wasn’t it?” said Harry. “I feel","book 2"
"really full, don’t you?”","book 2"
"Laughing at the astonished look on Dudley’s face, Harry took","book 2"
"the stairs three at a time, and hurled himself back into his","book 2"
"bedroom.","book 2"
"The first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She was sitting","book 2"
"in her cage, staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and","book 2"
"clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about","book 2"
"something. Exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost","book 2"
"at once.","book 2"
"“OUCH!” said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray,","book 2"
"feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head. Harry massaged","book 2"
"the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit him, and","book 2"
"saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of his hand,","book 2"
"whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework. Harry","book 2"
"then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet. Harry","book 2"
"bent down, recognized Ron’s handwriting, then tore open the envelope.","book 2"
"Inside was a hastily scribbled note.","book 2"
"Harry — DAD GOT THE TICKETS — Ireland versus","book 2"
"Bulgaria, Monday night. Mum’s writing to the Muggles to ask","book 2"
"you to stay. They might already have the letter, I don’t know","book 2"
"how fast Muggle post is. Thought I’d send this with Pig","book 2"
"anyway.","book 2"
"Harry stared at the word “Pig,” then looked up at the tiny owl","book 2"
"now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling. He had never","book 2"
"seen anything that looked less like a pig. Maybe he couldn’t read","book 2"
"Ron’s writing. He went back to the letter:","book 2"
"We’re coming for you whether the Muggles like it or not, you","book 2"
"can’t miss the World Cup, only Mum and Dad reckon it’s better","book 2"
"if we pretend to ask their permission first. If they say yes, send","book 2"
"Pig back with your answer pronto, and we’ll come and get you","book 2"
"at five o’clock on Sunday. If they say no, send Pig back pronto","book 2"
"and we’ll come and get you at five o’clock on Sunday anyway.","book 2"
"Hermione’s arriving this afternoon. Percy’s started work —","book 2"
"the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Don’t","book 2"
"mention anything about Abroad while you’re here unless you","book 2"
"want the pants bored off you.","book 2"
"See you soon —","book 2"
"“Calm down!” Harry said as the small owl flew low over his","book 2"
"head, twittering madly with what Harry could only assume was","book 2"
"pride at having delivered the letter to the right person. “Come here,","book 2"
"I need you to take my answer back!”","book 2"
"The owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig’s cage. Hedwig looked","book 2"
"coldly up at it, as though daring it to try and come any closer.","book 2"
"Harry seized his eagle-feather quill once more, grabbed a fresh","book 2"
"piece of parchment, and wrote:","book 2"
"Ron, it’s all okay, the Muggles say I can come. See you five","book 2"
"o’clock tomorrow. Can’t wait.","book 2"
"He folded this note up very small, and with immense difficulty,","book 2"
"tied it to the tiny owl’s leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement.","book 2"
"The moment the note was secure, the owl was off again; it","book 2"
"zoomed out of the window and out of sight.","book 2"
"Harry turned to Hedwig.","book 2"
"“Feeling up to a long journey?” he asked her.","book 2"
"Hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way.","book 2"
"“Can you take this to Sirius for me?” he said, picking up his letter.","book 2"
"“Hang on . . . I just want to finish it.”","book 2"
"He unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript.","book 2"
"If you want to contact me, I’ll be at my friend Ron Weasley’s for","book 2"
"the rest of the summer. His dad’s got us tickets for the Quidditch","book 2"
"World Cup!","book 2"
"The letter finished, he tied it to Hedwig’s leg; she kept unusually","book 2"
"still, as though determined to show him how a real post owl should","book 2"
"behave.","book 2"
"“I’ll be at Ron’s when you get back, all right?” Harry told her.","book 2"
"She nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft swooshing","book 2"
"noise, spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open","book 2"
"window.","book 2"
"Harry watched her out of sight, then crawled under his bed,","book 2"
"wrenched up the loose floorboard, and pulled out a large chunk of","book 2"
"birthday cake. He sat there on the floor eating it, savoring the happiness","book 2"
"that was flooding through him. He had cake, and Dudley","book 2"
"had nothing but grapefruit; it was a bright summer’s day, he would","book 2"
"be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, his scar felt perfectly normal","book 2"
"again, and he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup. It was","book 2"
"hard, just now, to feel worried about anything — even Lord","book 2"
"Voldemort.","book 2"
"BACK TO THE BURROW","book 2"
"By twelve o’clock the next day, Harry’s school trunk was packed","book 2"
"with his school things and all his most prized possessions —","book 2"
"the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick","book 2"
"he had gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he","book 2"
"had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year. He had emptied","book 2"
"his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food, doublechecked","book 2"
"every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten","book 2"
"spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting","book 2"
"down the days to September the first, on which he liked to","book 2"
"cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.","book 2"
"The atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was extremely","book 2"
"tense. The imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards","book 2"
"was making the Dursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon","book 2"
"had looked downright alarmed when Harry informed him that the","book 2"
"Weasleys would be arriving at five o’clock the very next day.","book 2"
"“I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,” he","book 2"
"snarled at once. “I’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They’d","book 2"
"better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that’s all.”","book 2"
"Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr. or","book 2"
"Mrs. Weasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call “normal.”","book 2"
"Their children might don Muggle clothing during the holidays,","book 2"
"but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying","book 2"
"states of shabbiness. Harry wasn’t bothered about what the neighbors","book 2"
"would think, but he was anxious about how rude the Dursleys","book 2"
"might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst","book 2"
"idea of wizards.","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this","book 2"
"might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it","book 2"
"was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating.","book 2"
"Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished.","book 2"
"This was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to","book 2"
"fright. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fullygrown","book 2"
"wizard with a curly pig’s tail poking out of the seat of his","book 2"
"trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its","book 2"
"removal at a private hospital in London. It wasn’t altogether surprising,","book 2"
"therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously","book 2"
"over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as","book 2"
"not to present the same target to the enemy.","book 2"
"Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn’t even protest at","book 2"
"the food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn’t","book 2"
"eating anything at all. Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed,","book 2"
"and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back","book 2"
"the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.","book 2"
"“They’ll be driving, of course?” Uncle Vernon barked across the","book 2"
"table.","book 2"
"“Er,” said Harry.","book 2"
"He hadn’t thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick","book 2"
"him up? They didn’t have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they","book 2"
"had once owned was currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest","book 2"
"at Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of","book 2"
"Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today?","book 2"
"“I think so,” said Harry.","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Vernon","book 2"
"would have asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to","book 2"
"judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were. But","book 2"
"Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon would have taken to Mr.","book 2"
"Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.","book 2"
"Harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn’t","book 2"
"stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains","book 2"
"every few seconds, as though there had been a warning about an escaped","book 2"
"rhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went back","book 2"
"downstairs and into the living room.","book 2"
"Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle","book 2"
"Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not","book 2"
"moving, and Harry was sure he was really listening with all his","book 2"
"might for the sound of an approaching car. Dudley was crammed","book 2"
"into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him, clamped firmly","book 2"
"around his bottom. Harry couldn’t take the tension; he left the","book 2"
"room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his","book 2"
"watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.","book 2"
"But five o’clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring","book 2"
"slightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the","book 2"
"street, then withdrew his head quickly.","book 2"
"“They’re late!” he snarled at Harry.","book 2"
"“I know,” said Harry. “Maybe — er — the traffic’s bad, or","book 2"
"something.”","book 2"
"Ten past five . . . then a quarter past five . . . Harry was starting","book 2"
"to feel anxious himself now. At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon","book 2"
"and Aunt Petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room.","book 2"
"“No consideration at all.”","book 2"
"“We might’ve had an engagement.”","book 2"
"“Maybe they think they’ll get invited to dinner if they’re late.”","book 2"
"“Well, they most certainly won’t be,” said Uncle Vernon, and","book 2"
"Harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room.","book 2"
"“They’ll take the boy and go, there’ll be no hanging around. That’s","book 2"
"if they’re coming at all. Probably mistaken the day. I daresay their","book 2"
"kind don’t set much store by punctuality. Either that or they drive","book 2"
"some tin-pot car that’s broken d — AAAAAAAARRRRRGH!”","book 2"
"Harry jumped up. From the other side of the living room door","book 2"
"came the sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken,","book 2"
"across the room. Next moment Dudley came flying into the hall,","book 2"
"looking terrified.","book 2"
"“What happened?” said Harry. “What’s the matter?”","book 2"
"But Dudley didn’t seem able to speak. Hands still clamped over","book 2"
"his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry","book 2"
"hurried into the living room.","book 2"
"Loud hangings and scrapings were coming from behind the","book 2"
"Dursleys’ boarded-up fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged","book 2"
"in front of it.","book 2"
"“What is it?” gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall","book 2"
"and was staring, terrified, toward the fire. “What is it, Vernon?”","book 2"
"But they were left in doubt barely a second longer. Voices could","book 2"
"be heard from inside the blocked fireplace.","book 2"
"“Ouch! Fred, no — go back, go back, there’s been some kind of","book 2"
"mistake — tell George not to — OUCH! George, no, there’s no","book 2"
"room, go back quickly and tell Ron —”","book 2"
"“Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad — maybe he’ll be able to let us","book 2"
"out —”","book 2"
"There was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the","book 2"
"electric fire.","book 2"
"“Harry? Harry, can you hear us?”","book 2"
"The Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry wolverines.","book 2"
"“What is this?” growled Uncle Vernon. “What’s going on?”","book 2"
"“They — they’ve tried to get here by Floo powder,” said Harry,","book 2"
"fighting a mad desire to laugh. “They can travel by fire — only","book 2"
"you’ve blocked the fireplace — hang on —”","book 2"
"He approached the fireplace and called through the boards.","book 2"
"“Mr. Weasley? Can you hear me?”","book 2"
"The hammering stopped. Somebody inside the chimney piece","book 2"
"said, “Shh!”","book 2"
"“Mr. Weasley, it’s Harry . . . the fireplace has been blocked up.","book 2"
"You won’t be able to get through there.”","book 2"
"“Damn!” said Mr. Weasley’s voice. “What on earth did they","book 2"
"want to block up the fireplace for?”","book 2"
"“They’ve got an electric fire,” Harry explained.","book 2"
"“Really?” said Mr. Weasley’s voice excitedly. “Eclectic, you say?","book 2"
"With a plug? Gracious, I must see that. . . . Let’s think . . . ouch,","book 2"
"Ron!”","book 2"
"Ron’s voice now joined the others’.","book 2"
"“What are we doing here? Has something gone wrong?”","book 2"
"“Oh no, Ron,” came Fred’s voice, very sarcastically. “No, this is","book 2"
"exactly where we wanted to end up.”","book 2"
"“Yeah, we’re having the time of our lives here,” said George,","book 2"
"whose voice sounded muffled, as though he was squashed against","book 2"
"the wall.","book 2"
"“Boys, boys . . .” said Mr. Weasley vaguely. “I’m trying to think","book 2"
"what to do. . . . Yes . . . only way . . . Stand back, Harry.”","book 2"
"Harry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however, moved","book 2"
"forward.","book 2"
"“Wait a moment!” he bellowed at the fire. “What exactly are you","book 2"
"going to —”","book 2"
"BANG.","book 2"
"The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-up fireplace","book 2"
"burst outward, expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a","book 2"
"cloud of rubble and loose chippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell","book 2"
"backward over the coffee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before she","book 2"
"hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the Weasleys, all of whom","book 2"
"had bright red hair, including Fred and George, who were identical","book 2"
"to the last freckle.","book 2"
"“That’s better,” panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long","book 2"
"green robes and straightening his glasses. “Ah — you must be","book 2"
"Harry’s aunt and uncle!”","book 2"
"Tall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his","book 2"
"hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces,","book 2"
"dragging Aunt Petunia. Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon. His","book 2"
"best suit was covered in white dust, which had settled in his hair","book 2"
"and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty","book 2"
"years.","book 2"
"“Er — yes — sorry about that,” said Mr. Weasley, lowering his","book 2"
"hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace. “It’s all","book 2"
"my fault. It just didn’t occur to me that we wouldn’t be able to get","book 2"
"out at the other end. I had your fireplace connected to the Floo","book 2"
"Network, you see — just for an afternoon, you know, so we could","book 2"
"get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren’t supposed to be connected,","book 2"
"strictly speaking — but I’ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation","book 2"
"Panel and he fixed it for me. I can put it right in a jiffy,","book 2"
"though, don’t worry. I’ll light a fire to send the boys back, and then","book 2"
"I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate.”","book 2"
"Harry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn’t understood a","book 2"
"single word of this. They were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck.","book 2"
"Aunt Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon.","book 2"
"“Hello, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley brightly. “Got your trunk","book 2"
"ready?”","book 2"
"“It’s upstairs,” said Harry, grinning back.","book 2"
"“We’ll get it,” said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he and","book 2"
"George left the room. They knew where Harry’s bedroom was, having","book 2"
"once rescued him from it in the dead of night. Harry suspected","book 2"
"that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they","book 2"
"had heard a lot about him from Harry.","book 2"
"“Well,” said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he","book 2"
"tried to find words to break the very nasty silence. “Very — erm —","book 2"
"very nice place you’ve got here.”","book 2"
"As the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and","book 2"
"bits of brick, this remark didn’t go down too well with the Dursleys.","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon’s face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia","book 2"
"started chewing her tongue again. However, they seemed too","book 2"
"scared to actually say anything.","book 2"
"Mr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do","book 2"
"with Muggles. Harry could see him itching to go and examine the","book 2"
"television and the video recorder.","book 2"
"“They run off eckeltricity, do they?” he said knowledgeably. “Ah","book 2"
"yes, I can see the plugs. I collect plugs,” he added to Uncle Vernon.","book 2"
"“And batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife","book 2"
"thinks I’m mad, but there you are.”","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. He","book 2"
"moved ever so slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from","book 2"
"view, as though he thought Mr. Weasley might suddenly run at","book 2"
"them and attack.","book 2"
"Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the","book 2"
"clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had","book 2"
"scared Dudley out of the kitchen. Dudley edged along the wall,","book 2"
"gazing at Mr. Weasley with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal","book 2"
"himself behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon’s","book 2"
"bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was","book 2"
"nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.","book 2"
"“Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?” said Mr. Weasley, taking","book 2"
"another brave stab at making conversation.","book 2"
"“Yep,” said Harry, “that’s Dudley.”","book 2"
"He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away","book 2"
"from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost","book 2"
"overwhelming. Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though","book 2"
"afraid it might fall off. Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely","book 2"
"concerned at Dudley’s peculiar behavior. Indeed, from the tone of","book 2"
"his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr.","book 2"
"Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought","book 2"
"he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.","book 2"
"“Having a good holiday, Dudley?” he said kindly.","book 2"
"Dudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder","book 2"
"over his massive backside.","book 2"
"Fred and George came back into the room carrying Harry’s","book 2"
"school trunk. They glanced around as they entered and spotted","book 2"
"Dudley. Their faces cracked into identical evil grins.","book 2"
"“Ah, right,” said Mr. Weasley. “Better get cracking then.”","book 2"
"He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand.","book 2"
"Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one.","book 2"
"“Incendio!” said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in","book 2"
"the wall behind him.","book 2"
"Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though","book 2"
"they had been burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring","book 2"
"bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder","book 2"
"inside, and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green","book 2"
"and roared higher than ever.","book 2"
"“Off you go then, Fred,” said Mr. Weasley.","book 2"
"“Coming,” said Fred. “Oh no — hang on —”","book 2"
"A bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred’s pocket and the contents","book 2"
"were now rolling in every direction — big, fat toffees in brightly","book 2"
"colored wrappers.","book 2"
"Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket,","book 2"
"then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked","book 2"
"right into the fire, saying “the Burrow!” Aunt Petunia gave a little","book 2"
"shuddering gasp. There was a whooshing sound, and Fred","book 2"
"vanished.","book 2"
"“Right then, George,” said Mr. Weasley, “you and the trunk.”","book 2"
"Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames","book 2"
"and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better. Then, with","book 2"
"a second whoosh, George had cried “the Burrow!” and vanished","book 2"
"too.","book 2"
"“Ron, you next,” said Mr. Weasley.","book 2"
"“See you,” said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned","book 2"
"broadly at Harry, then stepped into the fire, shouted “the Burrow!”","book 2"
"and disappeared.","book 2"
"Now Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.","book 2"
"“Well . . . ’bye then,” Harry said to the Dursleys.","book 2"
"They didn’t say anything at all. Harry moved toward the fire, but","book 2"
"just as he reached the edge of the hearth, Mr. Weasley put out a","book 2"
"hand and held him back. He was looking at the Dursleys in","book 2"
"amazement.","book 2"
"“Harry said good-bye to you,” he said. “Didn’t you hear him?”","book 2"
"“It doesn’t matter,” Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley. “Honestly, I","book 2"
"don’t care.”","book 2"
"Mr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry’s shoulder.","book 2"
"“You aren’t going to see your nephew till next summer,” he said","book 2"
"to Uncle Vernon in mild indignation. “Surely you’re going to say","book 2"
"good-bye?”","book 2"
"Uncle Vernon’s face worked furiously. The idea of being taught","book 2"
"consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living","book 2"
"room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering. But Mr.","book 2"
"Weasley’s wand was still in his hand, and Uncle Vernon’s tiny eyes","book 2"
"darted to it once, before he said, very resentfully, “Good-bye, then.”","book 2"
"“See you,” said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green","book 2"
"flames, which felt pleasantly like warm breath. At that moment,","book 2"
"however, a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him, and Aunt","book 2"
"Petunia started to scream.","book 2"
"Harry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind","book 2"
"his parents. He was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was","book 2"
"gagging and sputtering on a foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was","book 2"
"protruding from his mouth. One bewildered second later, Harry","book 2"
"realized that the foot-long thing was Dudley’s tongue — and that a","book 2"
"brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him.","book 2"
"Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley,","book 2"
"seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it","book 2"
"out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered","book 2"
"worse than ever, trying to fight her off. Uncle Vernon was bellowing","book 2"
"and waving his arms around, and Mr. Weasley had to shout to","book 2"
"make himself heard.","book 2"
"“Not to worry, I can sort him out!” he yelled, advancing on","book 2"
"Dudley with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed","book 2"
"worse than ever and threw herself on top of Dudley, shielding him","book 2"
"from Mr. Weasley.","book 2"
"“No, really!” said Mr. Weasley desperately. “It’s a simple process —","book 2"
"it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it’s","book 2"
"only an Engorgement Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can","book 2"
"correct it —”","book 2"
"But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panicstricken;","book 2"
"Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley’s","book 2"
"tongue as though determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be","book 2"
"suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his","book 2"
"tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized","book 2"
"a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard","book 2"
"at Mr. Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in","book 2"
"the blasted fireplace.","book 2"
"“Now really!” said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing his wand.","book 2"
"“I’m trying to help!”","book 2"
"The Dark Lord","book 3"
"Ascending","book 3"
"The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart","book 3"
"in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood","book 3"
"quite still, wands directed at each other’s chests; then,","book 3"
"recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath","book 3"
"their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.","book 3"
"“News?” asked the taller of the two.","book 3"
"“The best,” replied Severus Snape.","book 3"
"The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles,","book 3"
"on the right by a high, nearty manicured hedge. The men’s","book 3"
"long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.","book 3"
"“Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding","book 3"
"in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging tress broke","book 3"
"the moonlight. “It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope","book 3"
"he will be satisfied. You should confident that your reception will","book 3"
"be good?”","book 3"
"Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into","book 3"
"a wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with","book 3"
"them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive","book 3"
"wrought-iron gates barring the men’s way. Neither of them broke","book 3"
"step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and","book 3"
"passed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke.","book 3"
"The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s footsteps. There","book 3"
"was a rustle somewhere to their right; Yaxley drew his wand again,","book 3"
"pointing it over his companion’s head, but the source of the noise","book 3"
"proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting","book 3"
"majestically along the top of the hedge.","book 3"
"“He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks . . . ” Yaxley","book 3"
"thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort.","book 3"
"A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end","book 3"
"of the straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs","book 3"
"windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a","book 3"
"fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape","book 3"
"and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at","book 3"
"their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.","book 3"
"The hallway was large, dimly light, and sumptuously decorated,","book 3"
"with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes","book 3"
"of the pale-faced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley","book 3"
"as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door","book 3"
"leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat,","book 3"
"then Snape turned the bronze handle.","book 3"
"The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and","book 3"
"ornate table. The room’s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly","book 3"
"up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire","book 3"
"beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded","book 3"
"mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold.","book 3"
"As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were","book 3"
"drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene; an apparently","book 3"
"unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving","book 3"
"slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected","book 3"
"in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below.","book 3"
"He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every","book 3"
"minute or so.","book 3"
"“Yaxley, Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head of the","book 3"
"table. “You are very nearly late.”","book 3"
"The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that","book 3"
"it was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more","book 3"
"than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, this face shone","book 3"
"through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and","book 3"
"gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that","book 3"
"he seemed to emit a pearly glow.","book 3"
"“Severus, here,” said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate","book 3"
"right. “Yaxley—beside Dolohov.”","book 3"
"The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around","book 3"
"the table followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke","book 3"
"first.","book 3"
"“So?”","book 3"
"“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry","book 3"
"Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.”","book 3"
"The interest around the table sharpened palpably; Some stiffened,","book 3"
"others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort.","book 3"
"“Saturday . . . at nightfall,” repeated Voldemort. His red eyes","book 3"
"fastened upon Snape’s black ones with such intensity that some of","book 3"
"the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves","book 3"
"would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however,","book 3"
"looked calmly back into Voldemort’s face and, after a moment or","book 3"
"two. Voldemort’s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.","book 3"
"“Good. Very good. And this information comes—”","book 3"
"“—from the source we discussed,” said Snape.","book 3"
"“My Lord.”","book 3"
"Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort","book 3"
"and Snape. All faces turned to him.","book 3"
"“My Lord, I have heard differently,”","book 3"
"Yaxley waited but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on,","book 3"
"“Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until","book 3"
"the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.”","book 3"
"Snape was smiling,","book 3"
"“My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail;","book 3"
"this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed","book 3"
"upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be","book 3"
"susceptible.”","book 3"
"“I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,” said","book 3"
"Yaxley.","book 3"
"“If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said Snape.","book 3"
"“I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in","book 3"
"the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have","book 3"
"infiltrated the Ministry.”","book 3"
"“The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a squat man","book 3"
"sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that","book 3"
"was echoed here and there along the table.","book 3"
"Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to","book 3"
"the body revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in","book 3"
"thought.","book 3"
"“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party","book 3"
"of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy—”","book 3"
"Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at","book 3"
"once, watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.","book 3"
"“Where are they going to hide the boy next?”","book 3"
"“At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape. “The place,","book 3"
"according to the source, has been given every protection that the","book 3"
"Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is","book 3"
"little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of","book 3"
"course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might","book 3"
"give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments","book 3"
"to break through the rest.”","book 3"
"“Well, Yaxley?” Voldemort called down the table, the firelight","book 3"
"glinting strangely in his red eyes. “Will the Ministry have fallen","book 3"
"by next Saturday?”","book 3"
"Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.","book 3"
"“My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have—with difficulty,","book 3"
"and after great effort—succeeded in placing an Imperius","book 3"
"Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.” Many of those sitting around Yaxley","book 3"
"looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long,","book 3"
"twisted face, clapped him on the back.","book 3"
"“It is a start,” said Voldemort. “But Thicknesse is only one","book 3"
"man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act.","book 3"
"One failed attempt on the Minister’s life will set me back a long","book 3"
"way.”","book 3"
"“Yes—my Lord, that is true—but you know, as Head of the","book 3"
"Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular","book 3"
"contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads","book 3"
"of all the other Ministry departments. I will, I think, be easy now","book 3"
"that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to","book 3"
"subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring","book 3"
"Scrimgeour down.”","book 3"
"“As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he","book 3"
"has converted the rest,” said Voldemort. “At any rate, it remains","book 3"
"unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we","book 3"
"cannot touch the boy at his destination, the it must be done while","book 3"
"he travels.”","book 3"
"“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who","book 3"
"seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. “We now","book 3"
"have several people planted within the Department of Magical","book 3"
"Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall","book 3"
"know immediately.”","book 3"
"“He will not do either,” said Snape. “The order is eschewing any","book 3"
"form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry;","book 3"
"they mistrust everything to do with the place.”","book 3"
"“All the better,” said Voldemort. “He will have to move in the","book 3"
"open. Easier to take, by far.”","book 3"
"Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he","book 3"
"went on, “I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too","book 3"
"many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them","book 3"
"have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors","book 3"
"than to his triumphs.”","book 3"
"The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively,","book 3"
"each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they","book 3"
"might be blamed for Harry Potter’s continued existence. Voldemort,","book 3"
"however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any","book 3"
"of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him.","book 3"
"“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and","book 3"
"chance, those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know","book 3"
"better now. I understand those things that I did not understand","book 3"
"before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”","book 3"
"At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail","book 3"
"sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of","book 3"
"those at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had","book 3"
"seemed to issue from below their feet.","book 3"
"“Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet,","book 3"
"thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes from the revolving","book 3"
"body above, “have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner","book 3"
"quiet?”","book 3"
"“Yes, m–my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table,","book 3"
"who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared, at","book 3"
"first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and","book 3"
"scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious","book 3"
"gleam of silver.","book 3"
"“As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again at the","book 3"
"tense faces of his followers, “I understand better now. I shall need,","book 3"
"for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill","book 3"
"Potter.”","book 3"
"The faces around his displayed nothing but shock; he might","book 3"
"have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms.","book 3"
"“No volunteers?” said Voldemort. “Let’s see . . . Lucius, I see","book 3"
"no reason for you to have a wand anymore.”","book 3"
"Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy","book 3"
"in the firelight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he","book 3"
"spoke, his voice was hoarse.","book 3"
"“My Lord?”","book 3"
"“Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.”","book 3"
"“I . . . ”","book 3"
"Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight","book 3"
"ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down","book 3"
"her back, but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his","book 3"
"wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew","book 3"
"a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in from","book 3"
"of his red eyes, examining it closely.","book 3"
"“What is it?”","book 3"
"“Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy.","book 3"
"“And the core?”","book 3"
"“Dragon—dragon heartstring.”","book 3"
"“Good,” said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand and compared","book 3"
"the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement;","book 3"
"for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort’s","book 3"
"want in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed","book 3"
"by Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously.","book 3"
"“Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?”","book 3"
"Some of the throng sniggered.","book 3"
"“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for","book 3"
"you? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than","book 3"
"happy of late . . . What is it about my presence in your home that","book 3"
"displeases you, Lucius?”","book 3"
"“Nothing—nothing, my Lord!”","book 3"
"“Such lies, Lucius . . . ”","book 3"
"The soft voice seems to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had","book 3"
"stopped moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a","book 3"
"shudder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard","book 3"
"sliding across the floor beneath the table.","book 3"
"The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair.","book 3"
"It rose, seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s","book 3"
"shoulders; its neck the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with","book 3"
"their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the","book 3"
"creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius","book 3"
"Malfoy.","book 3"
"“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my","book 3"
"return, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire","book 3"
"for so many years?”","book 3"
"“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as","book 3"
"he wiped sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it—we do.”","book 3"
"To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes","book 3"
"averted from Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco,","book 3"
"who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly","book 3"
"at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact.","book 3"
"“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her","book 3"
"voice constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here,","book 3"
"in our family’s house. There can be no higher pleasure.”","book 3"
"She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark","book 3"
"hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor;","book 3"
"where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward","book 3"
"Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longer for","book 3"
"closeness.","book 3"
"“No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a","book 3"
"little to one side as he considered Bellatrix. “That means a great","book 3"
"deal, Bellatrix, from you,”","book 3"
"Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight.","book 3"
"“My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!”","book 3"
"“No higher pleasure . . . even compared with the happy event","book 3"
"that, I hear, has taken place in your family this week?”","book 3"
"She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused.","book 3"
"“I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.”","book 3"
"“I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And your, Lucius and","book 3"
"Narcissa. She has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You","book 3"
"must be so proud.”","book 3"
"There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table.","book 3"
"Many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks, a few thumped the","book 3"
"table with their fists. The great snake, disliking the disturbance,","book 3"
"opened its mouth and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did","book 3"
"not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys’","book 3"
"humiliation. Bellatrix’s face, so recently flushed with happiness,","book 3"
"had turned an ugly, blotchy red.","book 3"
"“She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring","book 3"
"of mirth. “We—Narcissa and I—have never set eyes on our sister","book 3"
"since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with","book 3"
"either of us, nor any beast she marries.”","book 3"
"“What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though his voice","book 3"
"was quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. “Will","book 3"
"you babysit the cubs?”","book 3"
"The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his","book 3"
"father, who was staring down into his own lap, then caught his","book 3"
"mother’s eye. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed","book 3"
"her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall.","book 3"
"“Enough,” said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake.","book 3"
"“Enough.”","book 3"
"And the laughter died at once.","book 3"
"“Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over","book 3"
"time,” he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring.","book 3"
"“You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut","book 3"
"away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.”","book 3"
"“Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with","book 3"
"tears of gratitude again. “At the first chance!”","book 3"
"“You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your family, so","book 3"
"in the world . . . we shall cut away the canker that infects us until","book 3"
"only those of the true blood remain . . . ”","book 3"
"Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy’s wand, pointed it directly at","book 3"
"the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it","book 3"
"a tiny flick. The figure came to life with a groan and began to","book 3"
"struggle against invisible bonds.","book 3"
"“Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked Voldemort.","book 3"
"Snape raised his eyes to the upside down face. All of the Death","book 3"
"Eaters were looking up at the captive now, as though they had","book 3"
"been given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face","book 3"
"the firelight, the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice. “Severus!","book 3"
"Help me!”","book 3"
"“Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.","book 3"
"“And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the snake’s snout","book 3"
"with his wand-free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that","book 3"
"the woman had woken, he seems unable to look at her anymore.","book 3"
"“But you would not have taken her classes,” said Voldemort.","book 3"
"“For those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by","book 3"
"Charity Burbage, who until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of","book 3"
"Witchcraft and Wizardry.”","book 3"
"There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A","book 3"
"broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled.","book 3"
"“Yes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and","book 3"
"wizards all about Muggles . . . how they are not so different from","book 3"
"us . . . ”","book 3"
"One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage","book 3"
"revolved to face Snape again.","book 3"
"“Severus . . . please . . . please . . . ”","book 3"
"“Silence,” said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy’s","book 3"
"wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged. “Not content with","book 3"
"corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last","book 3"
"week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods","book 3"
"in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she says, must accept","book 3"
"those thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling","book 3"
"of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable","book 3"
"circumstance . . . She would have use all mate with Muggles . . . or,","book 3"
"no doubt, werewolves . . . ”","book 3"
"Nobody laughed this time; There was no mistaking the anger","book 3"
"and contempt in Voldemort’s voice. For the third time, Charity","book 3"
"Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes","book 3"
"into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she","book 3"
"turned slowly away from his again.","book 3"
"“Avada Kedavra.”","book 3"
"The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room.","book 3"
"Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which","book 3"
"trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in","book 3"
"their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor.","book 3"
"“Dinner, Nagini,” said Voldemort softly, and the great snake","book 3"
"swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood.","book 3"
"In Memoriam","book 3"
"Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left","book 3"
"and sweating under his breath, he shouldered open his","book 3"
"bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china.","book 3"
"He had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been","book 3"
"sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door.","book 3"
"“What the—?”","book 3"
"He looked around, the landing of number four, Privet Drive,","book 3"
"was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley’s idea of a clever","book 3"
"booby trap. Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped","book 3"
"the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them","book 3"
"into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door.","book 3"
"Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under","book 3"
"the tap.","book 3"
"It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still","book 3"
"had four days left of being unable to perform magic . . . but he had","book 3"
"to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have","book 3"
"defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and","book 3"
"now he came to think of it—particularly in light of his immediate","book 3"
"plans—it seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. Making a","book 3"
"mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad","book 3"
"of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before","book 3"
"returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.","book 3"
"Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school","book 3"
"trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the","book 3"
"start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off","book 3"
"the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated","book 3"
"them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom—old quills,","book 3"
"desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previously,","book 3"
"Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a","book 3"
"stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn","book 3"
"it to see a lot of blood. He now proceeded a little more cautiously.","book 3"
"Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the","book 3"
"bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between","book 3"
"SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a","book 3"
"cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which","book 3"
"a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the","book 3"
"sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It","book 3"
"was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead","book 3"
"godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously","book 3"
"around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained","book 3"
"of his godfather’s last gift except powdered glass, which clung to","book 3"
"the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.","book 3"
"Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut","book 3"
"himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back","book 3"
"at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning’s","book 3"
"Daily Prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to","book 3"
"stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret","book 3"
"and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned,","book 3"
"by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.","book 3"
"It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the","book 3"
"useless items, and sort the remainder in piles according to whether","book 3"
"or not he would need them from now on. His school and Quidditch","book 3"
"robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were","book 3"
"piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and","book 3"
"uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, probably,","book 3"
"as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle","book 3"
"clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books,","book 3"
"the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters,","book 3"
"and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In","book 3"
"a front pocket were the Marauder’s Map and the locket with the","book 3"
"note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this place","book 3"
"on honor not because it was valuable—in all usual senses it was","book 3"
"worthless—but because of what it had cost to attain it.","book 3"
"This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside","book 3"
"his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent","book 3"
"at Privet Drive this summer.","book 3"
"He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk.","book 3"
"Hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers,","book 3"
"throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one. The owl as","book 3"
"asleep, or else faking: she was angry with Harry about the limited","book 3"
"amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment.","book 3"
"As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed","book 3"
"down, searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived","book 3"
"shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he remembered","book 3"
"that there had been a small mention on the front about","book 3"
"the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at","book 3"
"Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into","book 3"
"his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for.","book 3"
"ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED","book 3"
"by Elphias Doge","book 3"
"I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our","book 3"
"first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attraction was","book 3"
"undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves","book 3"
"to be outsiders. I had contracted dragon pox","book 3"
"shortly before arriving at school, and while I was","book 3"
"no longer contagious, my pockmarked visage and","book 3"
"greenish hue did not encourage many to approach","book 3"
"me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts","book 3"
"under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a","book 3"
"year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted","book 3"
"of a savage and well-publicized attack upon","book 3"
"three young Muggles.","book 3"
"Albus never attempted to deny that his father","book 3"
"(who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this","book 3"
"crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage","book 3"
"to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father","book 3"
"to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to","book 3"
"speak of the sad business, though many attempted","book 3"
"to make him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to","book 3"
"praise his father’s action and assumed that Albus","book 3"
"too was a Muggle-hater. They could not have been","book 3"
"more mistaken. As anybody who knew Albus would","book 3"
"attest, he never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle","book 3"
"tendency. Indeed, his determined support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent","book 3"
"years.","book 3"
"In a matter of months, however, Albus’s own","book 3"
"fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. By","book 3"
"the end of his first year he would never again be","book 3"
"known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing","book 3"
"more or less than the most brilliant student ever","book 3"
"seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged","book 3"
"to be his friends benefited from his example, not to","book 3"
"mention his help and encouragement, with which he","book 3"
"was always generous. He confessed to me in later life","book 3"
"that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure","book 3"
"lay in teaching.","book 3"
"He not only won every prize of note that the","book 3"
"school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence","book 3"
"with the most notable magical names of the","book 3"
"day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist;","book 3"
"Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and","book 3"
"Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several","book 3"
"of his papers found their way into learned publications","book 3"
"such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges","book 3"
"in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore’s","book 3"
"future career seemed likely to be meteoric,","book 3"
"and the only question that remained was when he","book 3"
"would become Minister of Magic. Though it was often","book 3"
"predicted in later years that he was on the point","book 3"
"of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial","book 3"
"ambitions.","book 3"
"Three years after we had started at Hogwarts,","book 3"
"Albus’s brother, Aberforth, arrived at school. They","book 3"
"were not alike; Aberforth was never bookish and,","book 3"
"unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by dueling","book 3"
"rather than through reasoned discussion. However,","book 3"
"it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that","book 3"
"the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along","book 3"
"as comfortably as two such different boys could do.","book 3"
"In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that","book 3"
"living in Albus’s shadow cannot have been an altogether","book 3"
"comfortable experience. Being continually","book 3"
"outshone was an occupational hazard of being his","book 3"
"friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable","book 3"
"as a brother.","book 3"
"When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to","book 3"
"take the then-traditional tour of the world together,","book 3"
"visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing","book 3"
"our separate careers. However, tragedy intervened.","book 3"
"On the very eve of our trip, Albus’s","book 3"
"mother, Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and","book 3"
"sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure","book 3"
"long enough to pay my respects at Kendra’s","book 3"
"funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary","book 3"
"journey. With a younger brother and sister to","book 3"
"care for, and little gold left to them, there could no","book 3"
"longer be any question of Albus accompanying me.","book 3"
"That was the period of our lives when we had","book 3"
"least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps","book 3"
"insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from","book 3"
"narrow escapes from chimeras in Greece to the experiments of Egyptian alchemists. His letters told","book 3"
"me little of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to","book 3"
"be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed","book 3"
"in my own experiences, it was with horror","book 3"
"that I heard, toward the end of my year’s travels,","book 3"
"that yet another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores:","book 3"
"the death of his sister, Ariana.","book 3"
"Though Ariana had been in poor health for a","book 3"
"long time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss","book 3"
"of their mother, had a profound effect on both of","book 3"
"her brothers. All those closest to Albus-and I count","book 3"
"myself one of that lucky number-agree that Ariana’s","book 3"
"death, and Albus’s feeling of personal responsibility","book 3"
"for it (though of course, he was guiltless), left their","book 3"
"mark upon him forevermore.","book 3"
"I returned home to find a young man who had","book 3"
"experienced a much older person’s suffering. Albus","book 3"
"was more reserved than before, and much less","book 3"
"lighthearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana","book 3"
"had led, not to a renewed closeness between","book 3"
"Albus and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In","book 3"
"time this would lift-in later years they reestablished,","book 3"
"if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial","book 3"
"one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of","book 3"
"Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to","book 3"
"mention them.","book 3"
"Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following","book 3"
"years. Dumbledore’s innumerable contributions","book 3"
"to the state ofWizarding knowledge, including","book 3"
"his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood,","book 3"
"will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom","book 3"
"he displayed in the many judgments he made while","book 3"
"Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They say, still,","book 3"
"that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between","book 3"
"Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who","book 3"
"witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe","book 3"
"they felt as they watched these two extraordinary","book 3"
"wizards do battle. Dumbledore’s triumph, and its","book 3"
"consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered","book 3"
"a turning point in magical history to match the","book 3"
"introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy","book 3"
"or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.","book 3"
"Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he","book 3"
"could find something to value in anyone, however","book 3"
"apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe","book 3"
"that his early losses endowed him with great humanity","book 3"
"and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship","book 3"
"more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared","book 3"
"to the Wizarding world’s. That he was the","book 3"
"most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts","book 3"
"headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he","book 3"
"lived, working always for the greater good and, to","book 3"
"his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a","book 3"
"small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day","book 3"
"that I met him.","book 3"
"Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying","book 3"
"the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar,","book 3"
"kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, ","book 3"
"he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of betraying Harry,","book 3"
"whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation.","book 3"
"He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since","book 3"
"reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had","book 3"
"barely known him at all. Never one had he imagined Dumbledore’s","book 3"
"childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into","book 3"
"being as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and","book 3"
"old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying","book 3"
"to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.","book 3"
"He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No","book 3"
"doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it","book 3"
"had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in","book 3"
"that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought","book 3"
"to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his","book 3"
"other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry,","book 3"
"Harry’s past, Harry’s future, Harry’s plans . . . and it seemed to","book 3"
"Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and","book 3"
"so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when","book 3"
"he had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though","book 3"
"the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was","book 3"
"also the only on he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered","book 3"
"honestly:","book 3"
"“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”","book 3"
"“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”","book 3"
"After several minutes’ thought, Harry tore the obituary out of","book 3"
"the Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume","book 3"
"of Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts.","book 3"
"Then he threw the rest of the newspaper into the rubbish pile and","book 3"
"turned to face the room. It was much tidier. The only things left","book 3"
"out of place were today’s Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and","book 3"
"on top of it, the piece of broken mirror.","book 3"
"Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today’s","book 3"
"Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the","book 3"
"piece of broken mirror.","book 3"
"Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today’s","book 3"
"Prophet, and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced","book 3"
"at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the","book 3"
"delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after nothing","book 3"
"that it said nothing about Voldemort. Harry was sure that","book 3"
"the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about","book 3"
"Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what he had","book 3"
"missed.","book 3"
"Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was","book 3"
"set over a picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried:","book 3"
"DUMBLEDORE—THE TRUTH AT LAST?","book 3"
"Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed","book 3"
"genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard","book 3"
"of his generation. Stripping away the popular image","book 3"
"of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter","book 3"
"reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth,","book 3"
"the lifelong feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore","book 3"
"carried to his grave. WHY was the man","book 3"
"tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a","book 3"
"mere headmaster? WHAT was the real purpose of","book 3"
"the secret organization known as the Order of the","book 3"
"Phoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really meet his","book 3"
"end?","book 3"
"The answers to these and many more questions","book 3"
"are explored in the explosive new biography, The","book 3"
"Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter,","book 3"
"exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page","book 3"
"13, inside.","book 3"
"Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The","book 3"
"article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face:","book 3"
"a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde","book 3"
"hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning","book 3"
"smile, wiggling her fingers up at him. Doing his best to ignore this","book 3"
"nauseating image, Harry read on.","book 3"
"In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and","book 3"
"softer than her famously ferocious quill-portraits","book 3"
"might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her","book 3"
"cozy home, she leads me straight into the kitchen","book 3"
"for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes","book 3"
"without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip.","book 3"
"“Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer’s","book 3"
"dream,” says Skeeter. “Such a long, full life. I’m","book 3"
"sure my book will be the first of very, very many.”","book 3"
"Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her","book 3"
"nine-hundred-page book was completed a mere four","book 3"
"weeks after Dumbledore’s mysterious death in June.","book 3"
"I ask her how she managed this superfast feat.","book 3"
"“Oh, when you’ve been a journalist as long as","book 3"
"I have, working to a deadline is second nature. I","book 3"
"knew that the Wizarding world as clamoring for the","book 3"
"full story and I wanted to be the first to meet that","book 3"
"need.”","book 3"
"I mentioned the recent, widely publicized remarks","book 3"
"of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot","book 3"
"and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore’s,","book 3"
"that “Skeeter’s book contains less fact than","book 3"
"a Chocolate frog card.”","book 3"
"Skeeter throws back her head and laughs.","book 3"
"“Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him","book 3"
"a few years back about merpeople rights, bless him.","book 3"
"Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting","book 3"
"at the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me","book 3"
"to watch out for trout.”","book 3"
"And yet Elphias Doge’s accusations of inaccuracy","book 3"
"have been echoed in many places. Does Skeeter","book 3"
"really feel that four short weeks have been enough","book 3"
"to gain a full picture of Dumbledore’s long and extraordinary","book 3"
"life?","book 3"
"“Oh, my dear,” beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately","book 3"
"across the knuckles, “you know as well","book 3"
"as I do how much information can be generated by","book 3"
"a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word","book 3"
"‘no,’ and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People","book 3"
"were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway.","book 3"
"Not everyone thought he was so wonderful,","book 3"
"you know—he trod on an awful lot of important","book 3"
"toes. But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff,","book 3"
"because I’ve had access to a source most","book 3"
"journalists would swap their wands for, one who has","book 3"
"never spoken in public before and who was close to","book 3"
"Dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturb-","book 3"
"ing phase of his youth.”","book 3"
"The advance publicity of Skeeter’s biography has","book 3"
"certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store","book 3"
"for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a","book 3"
"blameless life. What were the biggest surprises she","book 3"
"uncovered, I ask?","book 3"
"“Now, come off it, Betty, I’m not giving away all","book 3"
"the highlights before anybody’s bought the book!”","book 3"
"laughs Skeeter. “But I can promise that anybody","book 3"
"who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his","book 3"
"beard is in for a rude awakening! Let’s just say","book 3"
"that nobody hearing him rage against You-Know-","book 3"
"Who would have dreamed that he dabbled in the","book 3"
"Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard","book 3"
"who spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he","book 3"
"wasn’t exactly broad-minded when he was younger!","book 3"
"Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an extremely murky","book 3"
"past, not to mention that very fishy family, which","book 3"
"he worked so hard to keep hushed up.”","book 3"
"I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore’s","book 3"
"brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the","book 3"
"Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor","book 3"
"scandal fifteen years ago.","book 3"
"“Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap.”","book 3"
"laughs Skeeter. “No, no, I’m talking about much","book 3"
"worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling","book 3"
"about with goats, worse even than the Mugglemaiming","book 3"
"father—Dumbledore couldn’t keep either","book 3"
"of them quiet anyway, they were both charged by","book 3"
"the Wizengamot. No, it’s the mother and the sister","book 3"
"that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a","book 3"
"positive nest of nastiness—but, as I say, you’ll have","book 3"
"to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details.","book 3"
"All I can say now is, it’s no wonder Dumbledore","book 3"
"never talked about how his nose got broken.”","book 3"
"Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter","book 3"
"deny the brilliance that led to Dumbledore’s many","book 3"
"magical discoveries?","book 3"
"“He had brains,” she concedes, “although many","book 3"
"now question whether he could really take full credit","book 3"
"for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in","book 3"
"chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already","book 3"
"discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood when","book 3"
"Dumbledore ‘borrowed’ his papers.”","book 3"
"But the importance of some of Dumbledore’s","book 3"
"achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. What","book 3"

"that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter","book 3"
"from the word go. Whether that was really in","book 3"

"bestseller, Dumbledore’s legions of admirers, meanwhile,","book 3"
"may well be trembling at what is soon to","book 3"
"emerge about their hero.","book 3"
"Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare","book 3"
"blankly at the page. Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit;","book 3"
"he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the","book 3"
"wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his","book 3"
"overflowing bin.","book 3"
"He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty","book 3"
"drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same","book 3"
"piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases","book 3"
"from Rita’s article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to","book 3"

"swap their wands for . . .","book 3"
"“Lies!” Harry bellowed, and though the window he saw the","book 3"
"next-door neighbor, who had paused to restart his lawn mower,","book 3"
"look up nervously.","book 3"
"Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror","book 3"
"danced away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his","book 3"
"fingers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which","book 3"
"Rita Skeeter was defaming him. . . .","book 3"
"A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on","book 3"
"the jagged edge of the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must","book 3"
"have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly","book 3"
"peach color of Aunt Petunia’s choosing: There was nothing blue","book 3"
"there for the mirror to reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment","book 3"
"again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back","book 3"
"at him.","book 3"
"He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it,","book 3"
"because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything","book 3"
"was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore","book 3"
"would never pierce him again.","book 3"
"The Dursleys Departing","book 3"
"The sound of the front door slamming echoed up the","book 3"
"stair and a voice yelled, “Oi, You!” Sixteen years of","book 3"
"being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt whom his","book 3"
"uncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not immediately","book 3"
"respond. He was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for","book 3"
"a split second, he had thought he say Dumbledore’s eye. It was","book 3"
"not until his uncle bellowed, “BOY!” that Harry got slowly to his","book 3"
"feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of","book 3"
"broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking","book 3"
"with him.","book 3"
"“You took your time!” roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared","book 3"
"at the top of the stairs. “Get down here, I want a word!”","book 3"
"Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans pockets.","book 3"
"When he reached the living room he found all three Dursleys. They","book 3"
"were dressed for traveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket,","book 3"
"Aunt Petunia in a neat salmon-colored coat, and Dudly, Harry’s","book 3"
"large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket.","book 3"
"“Yes?” asked Harry.","book 3"
"“Sit down!” said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows.","book 3"
"“Please!” added Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word","book 3"
"was sharp in his throat.","book 3"
"Harry sat. He though he knew what was coming. His uncle","book 3"
"began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following","book 3"
"his movements with anxious expressions. Finally, his large purple","book 3"
"face crumpled with concentration, Uncle Vernon stopped in front","book 3"
"of Harry and spoke.","book 3"
"“I’ve changed my mind,” he said.","book 3"
"“What a surprise,” said Harry.","book 3"
"“Don’t you talk in that tone—” began Aunt Petunia in a shrill","book 3"
"voice, but Vern Dursley waved her down.","book 3"
"“It’s all a lot of claptrap,” said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry","book 3"
"with piggy little eyes. “I’ve decided I don’t believe a word of it.","book 3"
"We’re staying put, we’re not going anywhere.”","book 3"
"Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation","book 3"
"and amusement. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every","book 3"
"twenty-four hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking","book 3"
"ad repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry’s favorite","book 3"
"moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dudley","book 3"
"had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had","book 3"
"been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and","book 3"
"collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.","book 3"
"“According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his","book 3"
"pacing up and down the living room, “we—Petunia, Dudley, and","book 3"
"I—are in danger. From—from—”","book 3"
"“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.","book 3"
"“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a","book 3"
"halt in front of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking","book 3"
"it’s over, and I believe it’s a plot to get the house.”","book 3"
"“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”","book 3"
"“This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead","book 3"
"starting to pulse. “Our house! House prices are skyrocketing","book 3"
"around here! You want us out of the way and then you’re going","book 3"
"to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before we know it the deeds will","book 3"
"be in your name and—”","book 3"
"“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get","book 3"
"this house? Are you actually as stupid as you look?”","book 3"
"“Don’t you dare—!” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon","book 3"
"waved her down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it","book 3"
"seemed, as nothing to the danger he has spotted.","book 3"
"“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already got a","book 3"
"house, my godfather left me one. So why would I want this one?","book 3"
"All the happy memories?”","book 3"
"There was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his","book 3"
"uncle with this argument.","book 3"
"“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again,","book 3"
"“that this Lord Thing—”","book 3"
"“—Voldemort,” said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve been","book 3"
"through this about a hundred times already. This isn’t a claim,","book 3"
"it’s fact, Dumbledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr.","book 3"
"Weasley—”","book 3"
"Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry","book 3"
"guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward of recollections of","book 3"
"the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry’s summer holidays,","book 3"
"of two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley","book 3"
"Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant","book 3"
"shock to the Dursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr.","book 3"
"Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance","book 3"
"could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.","book 3"
"“—Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry","book 3"
"pressed on remorselessly. “Once I’m seventeen, the protective","book 3"
"charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well","book 3"
"as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to","book 3"
"torture you to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks","book 3"
"by holding you hostage I’d come and try to rescue you.”","book 3"
"Uncle Vernon’s and Harry’s eyes met. Harry was sure that","book 3"
"in that instant they were both wondering the same thing. Then","book 3"
"Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed, “You’ve got to go into","book 3"
"hiding and the Order wants to help. You’re being offered serious","book 3"
"protection, the best there is.”","book 3"
"Uncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down.","book 3"
"Outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges. The next-door","book 3"
"neighbor’s lawn mower stalled again.","book 3"
"“I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked Vernon Dursley","book 3"
"abruptly.","book 3"
"“There is,” said Harry, surprised.","book 3"
"“Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me that, as","book 3"
"innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked","book 3"
"man, we ought to qualify for government protection!”","book 3"
"Harry laughed; he could not stop himself. It was so typical of","book 3"
"his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this","book 3"
"world that he despised and mistrusted.","book 3"
"“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry","book 3"
"replied. “We think the Ministry has been infiltrated.”","book 3"
"Uncle Vernon stroke to the fireplace and back, breathing so","book 3"
"heavily that his great black mustache tippled, his face still purple","book 3"
"with concentration.","book 3"
"“All right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again. “All","book 3"
"right, let’s say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection.","book 3"
"I still don’t see why we can’t have that Kingsley bloke.”","book 3"
"Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This","book 3"
"question has also been addressed half a dozen times.","book 3"
"“As I’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth. “Kingsley is","book 3"
"protecting the Mug—I mean, your Prime Minister.”","book 3"
"“Exactly—he’s the best!” said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the","book 3"
"blank television screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the","book 3"
"news, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister","book 3"
"as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had","book 3"
"mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a","book 3"
"certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused","book 3"
"the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly","book 3"
"not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they","book 3"
"had never seen him with his earring in.","book 3"
"“Well, he’s taken,” said Harry. “But Hestia Jones and Dedalus","book 3"
"Diggle are more than up to the job—”","book 3"
"“If we’d even seen CVs . . . ” began Uncle Vernon, but Harry","book 3"
"lost patience. Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now","book 3"
"pointing at the TV set himself.","book 3"
"“These accidents aren’t accidents—the crashes and explosions","book 3"
"and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last","book 3"
"watched the new. People are disappearing and dying and he’s","book 3"
"behind it—Voldemort. I’ve told you this over and over again, he","book 3"
"kills Muggles for fun. Even the fogs—they’re caused by dementors,","book 3"
"and if you can’t remember what they are, ask your son!”","book 3"
"Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his","book 3"
"parents’ and Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again","book 3"
"and asked, “There are . . . more of them?”","book 3"
"“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked","book 3"
"us, you mean? Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe","book 3"
"thousands by this time, seeing as they feed of fear and despair—”","book 3"
"“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made","book 3"
"your point—”","book 3"
"“I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all","book 3"
"of them—Death Eaters, dementors, maybe even Inferi—which","book 3"
"means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark Wizard—will be able","book 3"
"to find you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember","book 3"
"the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you’ll agree you","book 3"
"need help.”","book 3"
"There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid","book 3"
"smashing something down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate","book 3"
"through the intervening years. Aunt Petunia was looking","book 3"
"at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon","book 3"
"blurted out, “But what about my work? What about Dudley’s","book 3"
"school? I don’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout","book 3"
"wizards—”","book 3"
"“Don’t you understand?” shouted Harry. “They will torture","book 3"
"and kill you like they did my parents!”","book 3"
"“Dad,” said Dudley in a loud voice, “Dad—I’m going with these","book 3"
"Order people.”","book 3"
"“Dudley,” said Harry, “for the first time in your life, you’re","book 3"
"talking sense.”","book 3"
"He knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened","book 3"
"enough to accept the Order’s help, his parents would accompany","book 3"
"him: There could be no question of being separated from their","book 3"
"Duddykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece.","book 3"
"“They’ll be here in about five minutes,” he said, and when","book 3"
"none of the Dursleys replied, he left the room. The prospect of","book 3"
"parting—probably forever—from his aunt, uncle, and cousin was","book 3"
"one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was","book 3"
"nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What did you say","book 3"
"to one another at the end of sixteen years’ solid dislike?","book 3"
"Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack,","book 3"
"then poked a couple of own nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage.","book 3"
"They fell with dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them.","book 3"
"“We’re leaving soon, really soon,” Harry told her. “And then","book 3"
"you’ll be able to fly again.”","book 3"
"The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of","book 3"
"his room and downstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and","book 3"
"Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on their own.","book 3"
"“Harry Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry","book 3"
"had opened the door, a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping","book 3"
"him a deep bow. “An honor, as ever!”","book 3"
"“Thanks, Dedalus,” said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed","book 3"
"smile upon the dark-haired Hestia. “It’s really good of","book 3"
"you to do this . . . They’re through here, my aunt and uncle and","book 3"
"cousin . . . ”","book 3"
"“Good day to you, Harry Potter’s relatives!” said Dedalus happily,","book 3"
"striding into the living room. The Dursleys did not look at all","book 3"
"happy to be addressed thus; Harry half expected another change","book 3"
"of mind. Dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the","book 3"
"witch and wizard.","book 3"
"“I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry","book 3"
"has told you, is a simple one,” said Dedalus, pulling an immense","book 3"
"pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. “We shall","book 3"
"be leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic","book 3"
"in your house—Harry being still underage, it could provide the","book 3"
"Ministry with an excuse to arrest him—we shall be driving, say,","book 3"
"ten miles or so, before Disapparating to the safe location we have","book 3"
"picked out for you. You know how to drive, I take it?” he asked","book 3"
"Uncle Vernon politely.","book 3"
"“Know how to—? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!”","book 3"
"spluttered Uncle Vernon.","book 3"
"“Very clever of you, sir, very clever. I personally would be","book 3"
"utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,” said Dedalus.","book 3"
"He was clearly under the impression that he was flattering Vernon","book 3"
"Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every","book 3"
"word Dedalus spoke.","book 3"
"“Can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his mustache","book 3"
"rippling indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus or Hestia","book 3"
"seemed to hear him.","book 3"
"“You, Harry,” Dedalus continued, “will wait here for your","book 3"
"guard. There has been a little change in the arrangements—”","book 3"
"“What d’you mean?” said Harry at once. “I thought Mad-Eye","book 3"
"was going to come and take me by Side-Along-Apparition?”","book 3"
"“Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely. “Mad-Eye will explain.”","book 3"
"The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter","book 3"
"incomprehension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched,","book 3"
"“Hurry up!” Harry looked all around the room before realizing","book 3"
"that the voice had issued from Dedalus’s pocket watch.","book 3"
"“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said","book 3"
"Dedalus, nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat. ","book 3"
"“We are attempting to time your departure from the house","book 3"
"with your family’s Disapparition, Harry: thus, the charm breaks","book 3"
"as the moment you all head for safety.” He turned to the Dursleys.","book 3"
"“Well, are we all packed and ready to go?”","book 3"
"None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring,","book 3"
"appalled, at the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket.","book 3"
"“Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,” murmured","book 3"
"Hestia. She clearly felt that it would be tactless for them","book 3"
"to remain in the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged","book 3"
"loving, possibly tearful farewells.","book 3"
"“There’s no need,” Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made","book 3"
"any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly,","book 3"
"“Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.”","book 3"
"He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry’s hand, but at","book 3"
"the last moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist","book 3"
"and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome.","book 3"
"“Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp","book 3"
"of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.","book 3"
"Dudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly","book 3"
"ajar, reminding Harry a little of the giant, Grawp.","book 3"
"“Come along, then,” said Uncle Vernon.","book 3"
"He had already reached the living room door when Dudley","book 3"
"mumbled, “I don’t understand.”","book 3"
"“What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt Petunia,","book 3"
"looking up at her son.","book 3"
"Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry.","book 3"
"“Why isn’t he coming with us?”","book 3"
"Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, staring","book 3"
"at Dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a","book 3"
"ballerina.","book 3"
"“What?” said Uncle Vernon loudly.","book 3"
"“Why isn’t he coming too?” asked Dudley.","book 3"
"“Well, he—he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to","book 3"
"glare at Harry and asking, “You don’t want to, do you?”","book 3"
"“Not in the slightest,” said Harry.","book 3"
"“There you are,” Uncle Vernon told Dudley. “Now come on,","book 3"
"we’re off.”","book 3"
"He marched out of the room. They heard the front door open,","book 3"
"but Dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt","book 3"
"Petunia stopped too.","book 3"
"“What now?” barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway.","book 3"
"It seems that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult","book 3"
"to put into words. After sever moments of apparently painful","book 3"
"internal struggle he said, “But where’s he going to go?”","book 3"
"Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was","book 3"
"clear that Dudley was frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the","book 3"
"silence.","book 3"
"“But . . . surely you know where your nephew is going?” she","book 3"
"asked, looking bewildered.","book 3"
"“Certainly we know,” said Vernon Dursley. “He’s off with some","book 3"
"of your lot, isn’t he? Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard","book 3"
"the man, we’re in a hurry,”","book 3"
"Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but","book 3"
"Dudley did not follow.","book 3"
"“Off with some of our lot?”","book 3"
"Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before.","book 3"
"Witches and wizards seems stunned that his closest living relatives","book 3"
"took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter.","book 3"
"“It’s fine,” Harry assured her. “It doesn’t matter, honestly.”","book 3"
"“Doesn’t matter?” repeated Hestia, her voice rising ominously.","book 3"
"“Don’t these people realize what you’ve been through? What dangers","book 3"
"you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of the","book 3"
"anti-Voldemort movement?”","book 3"
"“Er—no, they don’t,” said Harry. “They think I’m a waste of","book 3"
"space actually, but I’m used to—”","book 3"
"“I don’t think you’re a waste of space.”","book 3"
"If Harry had not seen Dudley’s lips move, he might not have","book 3"
"believed it. As it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds","book 3"
"before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken","book 3"
"for one thing. Dudley had turned red. Harry was embarrassed and","book 3"
"astonished himself.","book 3"
"“Well . . . er . . . thanks, Dudley.”","book 3"
"Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy","book 3"
"for expression before mumbling, “You saved my life.”","book 3"
"“Not really,” said Harry. “It was your soul the dementor would","book 3"
"have taken . . . ”","book 3"
"He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no","book 3"
"contact during this summer or last, as Harry had come back to","book 3"
"Privet Drive so briefly and kept to his room so much. It now","book 3"
"dawned on Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he","book 3"
"had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at","book 3"
"all. Although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved","book 3"
"that Dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his","book 3"
"feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley","book 3"
"subsided into scarlet-faced silence.","book 3"
"Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look that changed to ","book 3"
"outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward","book 3"
"and embraced Dudley rather than Harry.","book 3"
"“S–so sweet, Dudders . . . ” she sobbed into his massive chest.","book 3"
"“S–such a lovely b–boy . . . s–saying thank you . . . ”","book 3"
"“But he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said Hestia indignantly.","book 3"
"“He only said he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!”","book 3"
"“Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ‘I love you,’” said","book 3"
"Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia","book 3"
"continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from","book 3"
"a burning building.","book 3"
"“Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet","book 3"
"again at the living room door. “I though we were on a tight schedule!”","book 3"
"“Yes—yes, we are,” said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching","book 3"
"these exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to","book 3"
"pull himself together. “We really must be off, Harry—”","book 3"
"He tripped forward and wrung Harry’s hand with both of his","book 3"
"own.","book 3"
"“—good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding","book 3"
"world rest upon your shoulders.”","book 3"
"“Oh,” said Harry. “right. Thanks.”","book 3"
"“Farewell, Harry,” said Hestia, also clasping his hand. “Our","book 3"
"thoughts go with you.”","book 3"
"“I hope everything’s okay,” said Harry with a glance toward","book 3"
"Aunt Petunia and Dudley.","book 3"
"“Oh, I’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” said Diggle","book 3"
"lightly, waving his hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him.","book 3"
"Dudley gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and","book 3"
"walked toward Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him","book 3"
"with magic. Then Dudley held out his large, pink hand.","book 3"
"“Blimey, Dudley,” said Harry over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs.","book 3"
"“did the dementors blow a different personality into you?”","book 3"
"“Dunno,” muttered Dudley. “See you, Harry.”","book 3"
"“Yeah . . . ” said Harry, taking Dudley’s hand and shaking it.","book 3"
"“Maybe. Take care, Big D.”","book 3"
"Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry","book 3"
"heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car","book 3"
"door slammed.","book 3"
"Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief,","book 3"
"looked around at the sound. She did not seem to have expected to","book 3"
"find herself alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief","book 3"
"into her pocket, she said, “Well—good-bye,” and marched toward","book 3"
"the door without looking at him.","book 3"
"“Good-bye,” said Harry.","book 3"
"She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the","book 3"
"strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him. She","book 3"
"gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge","book 3"
"of speech, but then, with a little jerk of her head, she bustled out","book 3"
"of the room after her husband and son.","book 3"
"The Seven Potters","book 3"
"Harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at the","book 3"
"window just in time to see the Dursleys’ cat swinging","book 3"
"out of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus’s top","book 3"
"hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in","book 3"
"the backseat. The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its","book 3"
"windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and","book 3"
"then it was gone.","book 3"
"Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack,","book 3"
"gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and","book 3"
"then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he","book 3"
"deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs.","book 3"
"The light was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows in the","book 3"
"evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence","book 3"
"and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time.","book 3"
"Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went","book 3"
"out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare","book 3"
"treat: Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he","book 3"
"had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley’s computer, or put on the","book 3"
"television and flicked through the channels to his heart’s content.","book 3"
"It gave him an odd, empty feeling to remember those times; it was","book 3"
"like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost.","book 3"
"“Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked Hedwig,","book 3"
"who was still sulking, with her head under her wing. “We’ll","book 3"
"never be here again. Don’t you want to remember all the good","book 3"
"times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories . . . Dudley","book 3"
"puked on it after I saved him from the dementors. . . . Turns out","book 3"
"he was grateful after all, can you believe it? . . . And last summer,","book 3"
"Dumbledore walked through that front door. . . .”","book 3"
"Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig","book 3"
"did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her","book 3"
"head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door.","book 3"
"“And under here, Hedwig”—Harry pulled open a door under","book 3"
"the stairs—“is where I used to sleep; You never knew me then—","book 3"
"Blimey, it’s small, I’d forgotten. . . .”","book 3"
"Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering","book 3"
"how he used to wake every morning looking up at the","book 3"
"underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned","book 3"
"with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had known","book 3"
"anything about his true identity; before he had found out how","book 3"
"his parents had died or why such strange things often happened","book 3"
"around him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had","book 3"
"dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes","book 3"
"of green light and once—Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car","book 3"
"when Harry had recounted it—a flying motorbike . . .","book 3"
"There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby.","book 3"
"Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head","book 3"
"on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle","book 3"
"Vernon’s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen,","book 3"
"clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back","book 3"
"garden.","book 3"
"The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering.","book 3"
"Then, one by one, figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment","book 3"
"Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid,","book 3"
"wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike","book 3"
"with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people","book 3"
"were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black","book 3"
"winged horses.","book 3"
"Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst.","book 3"
"There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms","book 3"
"around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, “All","book 3"
"righ’, Harry? Ready fer the off?”","book 3"
"“Definitely,” said Harry, beaming around at them all. “But I","book 3"
"wasn’t expecting this many of you!”","book 3"
"“Change of plan,” growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous,","book 3"
"bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from","book 3"
"darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. “Let’s","book 3"
"get undercover before we talk you through it.”","book 3"
"Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and","book 3"
"chattering, they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s","book 3"
"gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless","book 3"
"appliances: Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied","book 3"
"back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill,","book 3"
"badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding,","book 3"
"his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-legged, his","book 3"
"bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short","book 3"
"hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more","book 3"
"lined; Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde","book 3"
"hair; Kingsley, taller and broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild","book 3"
"hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on","book 3"
"the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog,","book 3"
"with his droopy bloodhound’s eyes and matted hair. Harry’s heart","book 3"
"seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of","book 3"
"all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the","book 3"
"last time they had met.","book 3"
"“Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime","book 3"
"Minister?” he called across the room.","book 3"
"“He can get along without me for one night,” said Kingsley.","book 3"
"“You’re more important.”","book 3"
"“Harry, guess what?” said Tonks from her perch on top of the","book 3"
"washing machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring","book 3"
"glittered there.","book 3"
"“You got married?” Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin.","book 3"
"“I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.”","book 3"
"“That’s brilliant, congrat—”","book 3"
"“All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy catch-up later,”","book 3"
"roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen.","book 3"
"Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry, “As","book 3"
"Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse","book 3"
"has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He’s made it","book 3"
"an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network,","book 3"
"place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the name","book 3"
"of your protection to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you.","book 3"
"Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother’s charm does that already.","book 3"
"What he’s really done is to stop you from getting out of","book 3"
"here safely.","book 3"
"“Second problem. You’re underage, which means you’ve still","book 3"
"got the Trace on you.”","book 3"
"“I don’t—”","book 3"
"“The Trace, the Trace!” said Mad-Eye impatiently. “The","book 3"
"charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the","book 3"
"way the Ministry finds out out about underage magic! If you, or","book 3"
"anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse","book 3"
"is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.","book 3"
"“We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you","book 3"
"turn seventeen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you.","book 3"
"In short: Pius Thicknesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and","book 3"
"proper.”","book 3"
"Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse.","book 3"
"“So what are we going to do?”","book 3"
"“We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the","book 3"
"only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast","book 3"
"spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.”","book 3"
"Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue","book 3"
"to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them.","book 3"
"“Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions:","book 3"
"when you come of age, or”—Moody gestured around the","book 3"
"pristine kitchen—“you no longer call this place home. You and","book 3"
"your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the","book 3"
"full understanding that you’re never going to live together again,","book 3"
"correct?”","book 3"
"Harry nodded.","book 3"
"“So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and","book 3"
"the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We’ve","book 3"
"choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for","book 3"
"You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.","book 3"
"“The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You-Know-who","book 3"
"doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail","book 3"
"to the Ministry: They think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth.","book 3"
"However, this is You-Know-Who we’re dealing with, so we can’t","book 3"
"just rely on him getting the date wrong; he’s bound to have a","book 3"
"couple Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just","book 3"
"in case. So we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection","book 3"
"we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place","book 3"
"we’re going to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the","book 3"
"Order: my house, Kingsley’s place, Molly auntie Muriel’s—you get","book 3"
"the idea.”","book 3"
"“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could","book 3"
"still spot a gaping hole in the plan.","book 3"
"“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the","book 3"
"boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house","book 3"
"you’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”","book 3"
"“Er—yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the","book 3"
"twelve secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort","book 3"
"of obvious once”—he performed a quick headcount—“fourteen of","book 3"
"us fly off towards Tonks’s parents’?”","book 3"
"“Ah,” said Moody. “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen","book 3"
"of us won’t be flying to Tonks’s parents. There will be seven Harry","book 3"
"Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a","book 3"
"companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.”","book 3"
"From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what","book 3"
"looked like mud. There was no need for him to say another word;","book 3"
"Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately.","book 3"
"“No!” he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen.","book 3"
"“No way!”","book 3"
"“I told them you’d take it like this,” said Hermione with a hint","book 3"
"of complacency.","book 3"
"“If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives—!”","book 3"
"“—because it’s the first time for all of us,” said Ron.","book 3"
"“This is different, pretending to be me—”","book 3"
"“Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,” said Fred earnestly.","book 3"
"“Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky,","book 3"
"sccrawny gits forever.”","book 3"
"Harry did not smile.","book 3"
"“You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you","book 3"
"some hair.”","book 3"
"“Well, that’s that plan scuppered,” said George. “Obviously","book 3"
"there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you","book 3"
"cooperate.”","book 3"
"“Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use","book 3"
"magic: we’ve got no chance,” said Fred.","book 3"
"“Funny,” said Harry, “really amusing.”","book 3"
"“If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled Moody, his","book 3"
"magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at","book 3"
"Harry.","book 3"
"“Everyone here’s overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to","book 3"
"take the risk.”","book 3"
"Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved","book 3"
"sideways to glare at him out of the side of Moody’s head.","book 3"
"“Let’s have no more arguments. Time’s wearing on. I want a","book 3"
"few of your hairs, boy, now.”","book 3"
"“But this is mad, there’s no need—”","book 3"
"“No need!” snarled Moody, “With You-Know-Who out there","book 3"
"and half the Ministry on his side? Potter, if we’re lucky he’ll have","book 3"
"swallowed the fake bait and he’ll be planning to ambush you on","book 3"
"the thirtieth, but he’d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two","book 3"
"keeping an eye out, it’s what I’d do. They might not be able to","book 3"
"get at you or this house while your mother’s charm holds, but it’s","book 3"
"about to break and they know the rough position of the place.","book 3"
"Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can’t split","book 3"
"himself into seven.”","book 3"
"Harry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at once.","book 3"
"“So, Potter—some of your hair, if you please.”","book 3"
"Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort","book 3"
"of way.","book 3"
"“Now!” barked Moody.","book 3"
"With all of their eyes on him, Harry reached up to the top of","book 3"
"his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.","book 3"
"“Good,” said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper","book 3"
"out of the flask of potion. “Straight in here, if you please.”","book 3"
"Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment","book 3"
"it made contact with its surface, the potion began to froth and","book 3"
"smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold.","book 3"
"“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,”","book 3"
"said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows,","book 3"
"blushing slightly, and saying, “Oh, you now what I mean—Goyle’s","book 3"
"potion looked like bogies.”","book 3"
"“Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please.” said","book 3"
"Moody.","book 3"
"Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of","book 3"
"Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink.","book 3"
"“We’re one short,” said Lupin.","book 3"
"“Here,” said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the","book 3"
"scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled","book 3"
"her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred","book 3"
"and George instead.","book 3"
"“I’ve told yer, I’d sooner be a protector,” said Mundungus.","book 3"
"“Shut it,” growled Moody. “As I’ve already told you, you spineless","book 3"
"worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture","book 3"
"Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-who","book 3"
"would want to finish Potter in person. It’ll be the protectors who","book 3"
"have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill","book 3"
"them.”","book 3"
"Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was","book 3"
"already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his","book 3"
"cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion","book 3"
"into each one.","book 3"
"“Altogether, then . . . ”","book 3"
"Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank.","book 3"
"All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats.","book 3"
"At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax.","book 3"
"Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and","book 3"
"George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermione’s and","book 3"
"Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls.","book 3"
"Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the","book 3"
"large sacks he had brought with him. When he straightened up","book 3"
"again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front","book 3"
"of him.","book 3"
"Fred and George turned to each other and said together,","book 3"
"“Wow—we’re identical!”","book 3"
"“I dunno, though. I think I’m still better looking,” said Fred,","book 3"
"examining his reflection in the kettle.","book 3"
"“Bah,” said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, “Bill,","book 3"
"don’t look at me—I’m ’ideous.”","book 3"
"“Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,”","book 3"
"said Moody, indicating the first sack, “and vice versa. Don’t forget","book 3"
"the glasses, there’s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you’re","book 3"
"dressed, there’s luggage in the other sack.”","book 3"
"The real Harry thought this might just be the most bizarre thing","book 3"
"he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He","book 3"
"watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling","book 3"
"out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, and stuffing their own things","book 3"
"away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for his","book 3"
"privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly more","book 3"
"at ease with displaying his body than they would have with their","book 3"
"own.","book 3"
"“I knew Ginny was lying about that that tattoo,” said Ron,","book 3"
"looking down at his bare chest.","book 3"
"“Harry, your eyesight really is awful,” said Hermione, as she","book 3"
"put on glasses.","book 3"
"Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages,","book 3"
"each containing a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack.","book 3"
"“Good,” said Moody, as at last the seven dressed, bespectacled,","book 3"
"and luggage-laden Harrys faced him. “The pairs will be as follows:","book 3"
"Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom—”","book 3"
"“Why’m I with you?” grunted the Harry nearest the back door.","book 3"
"“Because you’re the one that needs watching,” growled Moody,","book 3"
"and sure enough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus","book 3"
"as he continued. “Arthur and Fred—”","book 3"
"“I’m George,” said the twin at whom Moody was pointing,","book 3"
"“Can’t you even tell us apart when we’re Harry?”","book 3"
"“Sorry, George—”","book 3"
"“I’m only yanking your wand. I’m Fred really—”","book 3"
"“Enough messing around!!” snarled Moody. “The other one—","book 3"
"George or Fred or whoever you are—you’re with Remus. Miss","book 3"
"Delacour—”","book 3"
"“I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,” said Bill. “She’s not that fond","book 3"
"of brooms.”","book 3"
"Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy,","book 3"
"slavish look that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear","book 3"
"on his face again.","book 3"
"“Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral—”","book 3"
"Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile;","book 3"
"Harry knew that Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick.","book 3"
"“Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks brightly, knocking","book 3"
"over a mug tree as she waved at him.","book 3"
"Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione.","book 3"
"“An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all right?” said Hagrid,","book 3"
"looking a little anxious. “We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals","book 3"
"can’t take me weight, see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me","book 3"
"on it, though, so you’ll be in the sidecar.”","book 3"
"“That’s great,” said Harry, not altogether truthfully.","book 3"
"“We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,”","book 3"
"said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. “Snape’s","book 3"
"had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he’s never","book 3"
"mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re","book 3"
"betting they’ll choose one of the Potters who look at home on a","book 3"
"broomstick. All right then,” he went on, tying up the sack with the","book 3"
"fake Potters’ clothes in it and leading the way back to the door,","book 3"
"“I make it three minutes until we’re supposed to leave. No point","book 3"
"locking the back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when","book 3"
"they come looking. Come on . . . ”","book 3"
"Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig’s","book 3"
"cage and followed the ground to the dark back garden.","book 3"
"On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands. Hermione","book 3"
"had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley,","book 3"
"Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside the","book 3"
"motorbike, goggles on.","book 3"
"“Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike?”","book 3"
"“The very same,” said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. “An’","book 3"
"the last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!”","book 3"
"Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into","book 3"
"the sidecar. It placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron","book 3"
"smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper","book 3"
"car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet","book 3"
"and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees. It was extremely","book 3"
"uncomfortable.","book 3"
"“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said Hagrid, quite oblivious","book 3"
"to Harry’s discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle,","book 3"
"which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. “It’s got","book 3"
"a few tricks up its hindquarters now. Tha’ one was my idea.”","book 3"
"He pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer.","book 3"
"“Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr. Weasley, who was standing","book 3"
"beside them, holding his broomstick. “I’m still not sure this","book 3"
"was advisable and it’s certainly only to be used in emergencies.”","book 3"
"“All right then,” said Moody. “Everyone ready, please. I want","book 3"
"us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the","book 3"
"diversion’s lost.”","book 3"
"Everybody mounted their brooms.","book 3"
"“Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw","book 3"
"a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either","book 3"
"side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life. It roared","book 3"
"like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate.","book 3"
"“Good luck, everyone,” shouted Moody, “See you all in","book 3"
"about an hour at the Burrow. On the count of three.","book 3"
"One . . . two . . . THREE.”","book 3"
"There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the","book 3"
"sidecar give a nasty lurch. He was rising through the air fast, his","book 3"
"eyes water slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him","book 3"
"brooms were soaring upward too, the long black tail of a threstral","book 3"
"flicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig’s cage","book 3"
"and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So","book 3"
"great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse","book 3"
"of number four, Privet Drive, by the time he looked over the edge","book 3"
"of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. Higher and","book 3"
"higher they climbed into the sky—","book 3"
"And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded.","book 3"
"At least thirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a","book 3"
"vast circle in the midst of which the Order members had risen,","book 3"
"oblivious—","book 3"
"Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell","book 3"
"and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they","book 3"
"were. Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging","book 3"
"to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig’s cage, the Firebolt, and his","book 3"
"rucksack slipped from beneath his knees.","book 3"
"“No—HEDWIG!”","book 3"
"The broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize","book 3"
"the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike","book 3"
"swung the right way up again. A second’s relief, and then another","book 3"
"burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the","book 3"
"cage.","book 3"
"“No—NO!”","book 3"
"The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death","book 3"
"Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle.","book 3"
"“Hedwig—Hedwig—”","book 3"
"But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of","book 3"
"her cage. He could not take it in in, and his terror for the others","book 3"
"was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of","book 3"
"people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms","book 3"
"soaring off into the distance, but he could not tell who they were—","book 3"
"“Hagrid, we’ve got to go back, we’ve got to go back!” he yelled","book 3"
"over the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming","book 3"
"Hedwig’s cage into the floor, refusing to believe that she was","book 3"
"dead. “Hagrid, TURN AROUND!”","book 3"
"“My job’s ter get you there safe, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, and","book 3"
"he opened the throttle.","book 3"
"“Stop—STOP!” Harry shouted, but he looked back again as","book 3"
"two jets of green light flew past his left year: Four Death Eaters","book 3"
"had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming","book 3"
"for Hagrid’s broad back. Hagrid swerved but the Death Eaters","book 3"
"were keeping up with the bike, more curses shot after them, and","book 3"
"Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling","book 3"
"around he cried, “Stupefy!” and a red bolt of light shot from his","book 3"
"own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters","book 3"
"as they scattered to avoid it.","book 3"
"“Hold on, Harry, this’ll do it for ’em!” roared Hagrid, and Harry","book 3"
"looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into","book 3"
"a green button near the fuel gauge.","book 3"
"A wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe.","book 3"
"Craning his neck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair. Three","book 3"
"of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not","book 3"
"so lucky; He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder","book 3"
"from behind it, his broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows","book 3"
"slowed up to save him, but they and the airborne wall were","book 3"
"swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars","book 3"
"and sped up.","book 3"
"More Killing Curses flew past Harry’s head from the two remaining","book 3"
"Death Eaters’ wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry","book 3"
"responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided","book 3"
"in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought","book 3"
"wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea","book 3"
"what was happening—","book 3"
"“Here we go again, Harry, hold on!” yelled Hagrid, and he","book 3"
"jabbed at a second button. This time a great net burst from the","book 3"
"bike’s exhaust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did","book 3"
"they swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save","book 3"
"their unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed suddenly out","book 3"
"of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike,","book 3"
"all shooting curses after it.","book 3"
"“This’ll do it, Harry, hold on tight!” yelled Hagrid, and Harry","book 3"
"saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the","book 3"
"speedometer.","book 3"
"With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from","book 3"
"the exhaust, white-hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward","book 3"
"like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death","book 3"
"Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and","book 3"
"at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its metal connections","book 3"
"to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration.","book 3"
"“It’s all righ’, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto","book 3"
"his back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the","book 3"
"sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike’s slipstream.","book 3"
"“I’m on it, Harry, don’ worry!” Hagrid yelled, and from inside","book 3"
"his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella. “Hagrid! No!","book 3"
"Let me!”","book 3"
"“REPARO!”","book 3"
"There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from","book 3"
"the bike completely. Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus","book 3"
"of the bike’s flight, then the sidecar began to lose height—","book 3"
"In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and","book 3"
"shouted “Wingardium Leviosa!”","book 3"
"The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne.","book 3"
"He had but a split second’s relief, however, as more curses","book 3"
"streaked past him: The three Death Eaters were closing in.","book 3"
"“I’m comin’, Harry!” Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness,","book 3"
"but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching","book 3"
"as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures","book 3"
"and yelled, “Impedimenta!”","book 3"
"The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest; For a moment","book 3"
"the man was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit","book 3"
"an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him—","book 3"
"Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining","book 3"
"Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck","book 3"
"below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his","book 3"
"seat—","book 3"
"“I’m comin’, Harry, I’m comin’ !”","book 3"
"A huge hand seized the back of Harry’s robes and hoisted him","book 3"
"out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him","book 3"
"as he dragged himself onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself","book 3"
"back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the","book 3"
"two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth,","book 3"
"pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, “Confringo!”","book 3"
"He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded;","book 3"
"the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and","book 3"
"fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished.","book 3"
"“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned Hagrid, “I shouldn’ta","book 3"
"tried ter repair it myself—yeh’ve got no room—”","book 3"
"“It’s not a problem, just keep flying!” Harry shouted back,","book 3"
"as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing","book 3"
"closer.","book 3"
"As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again,","book 3"
"Hagrid swerved and zigzagged. Harry knew that Hagrid did not","book 3"
"dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so insecurely.","book 3"
"Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at","book 3"
"their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking","book 3"
"jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and","book 3"
"his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell,","book 3"
"Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike—Stan—","book 3"
"“Expelliarmus!” Harry yelled.","book 3"
"“That’s him, it’s him, it’s the real one!”","book 3"
"The hooded Death Eater’s shout reached Harry even above the","book 3"
"thunder of the motorbike’s engine. Next moment, both pursuers","book 3"
"had fallen back and disappeared from view.","book 3"
"“Harry, what’s happened?” bellowed Hagrid, “Where’ve they","book 3"
"gone?”","book 3"
"“I don’t know!”","book 3"
"But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted","book 3"
"“It’s the real one!”; how had he known? He gazed around at the","book 3"
"apparently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they?","book 3"
"He clamored around on the seat to face forward and seized hold","book 3"
"of the back of Hagrid’s jacket.","book 3"
"“Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let’s get out of here!”","book 3"
"“Hold on tight, then, Harry!”","book 3"
"There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue","book 3"
"fire shot from the exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backward off","book 3"
"what little of the seat he had, Hagrid flung backward upon him,","book 3"
"barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars—","book 3"
"“I think we’ve lost ’em Harry, I think we’ve done it!!” yelled","book 3"
"Hagrid.","book 3"
"But Harry was not convinced; Fear lapped at him as he looked","book 3"
"left and right for pursuers he was sue would come. . . .Why had they","book 3"
"fallen back? One of them had sitll had a wand. . . . It’s him . . . it’s","book 3"
"the real one. . . . They had said it right after he had tried to Disarm","book 3"
"Stan. . . .","book 3"
"“We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it!” shouted","book 3"
"Hagrid.","book 3"
"Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the","book 3"
"ground still seemed remote as stars.","book 3"
"Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire: as a Death Eater","book 3"
"appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry","book 3"
"by millimeters, cast from behind—","book 3"
"And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on","book 3"
"the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snakelike","book 3"
"face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his","book 3"
"wand again—","book 3"
"Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a","book 3"
"vertical dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells","book 3"
"flying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body fly past","book 3"
"him and knew he had hit one of them, but he heard a bang and","book 3"
"saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the","book 3"
"air, completely out of control—","book 3"
"Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea","book 3"
"which way was up, which down: His scar was still burning; he","book 3"
"expected to die at any second. A hooded figure on a broomstick","book 3"
"was feet from him, he saw it raise its arm—","book 3"
"“NO!”","book 3"
"With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the","book 3"
"Death Eater; to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death","book 3"
"Eater falling out of sight, their combined weight too much for the","book 3"
"broomstick—","book 3"
"Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry","book 3"
"heard Voldemort scream, “Mine!!”","book 3"
"It was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he","book 3"
"glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard,","book 3"
"“Avada—”","book 3"
"As the pain from Harry’s scar forced his eyes shut, his wand","book 3"
"acted of its own accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some","book 3"
"great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed","book 3"
"eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death","book 3"
"Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed, “No!”; Somehow, Harry found","book 3"
"his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched it with","book 3"
"his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air,","book 3"
"hurtling straight toward the ground.","book 3"
"“Hagrid!” Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life.","book 3"
"“Hagrid—Accio Hagrid!”","book 3"
"The motorbike sped up, sucked towards the earth. Face level","book 3"
"with the handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights","book 3"
"growing nearer and nearer. He was going to crash and there was","book 3"
"nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream,","book 3"
"“Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!”","book 3"
"He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he","book 3"
"stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing","book 3"
"he ever saw: Voldemort preparing to curse him once more—","book 3"
"And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw","book 3"
"Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him. He pulled hard at","book 3"
"the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with","book 3"
"an earsplitting, ground trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy","book 3"
"pond.","book 3"

"'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;","book 4"

"Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;","book 4"
"My lord and you were then at Mantua:--","book 4"
"Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,","book 4"

"Nurse:","book 4"
"Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,","book 4"

"And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow","book 4"
"A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;","book 4"
"A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:","book 4"
"'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?","book 4"

"That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,","book 4"
"That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;","book 4"
"So shall you share all that he doth possess,","book 4"
"By having him, making yourself no less.","book 4"

"Thou talk'st of nothing.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"True, I talk of dreams,","book 4"
"Which are the children of an idle brain,","book 4"
"Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,","book 4"
"Which is as thin of substance as the air","book 4"

"And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?","book 4"

"Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.","book 4"

"Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.","book 4"

"That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,","book 4"
"With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.","book 4"
"Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,","book 4"
"Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,","book 4"
"But to his foe supposed he must complain,","book 4"
"And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:","book 4"
"Being held a foe, he may not have access","book 4"
"To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;","book 4"
"And she as much in love, her means much less","book 4"
"To meet her new-beloved any where:","book 4"

"Romeo! my cousin Romeo!","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"He is wise;","book 4"
"And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:","book 4"
"Call, good Mercutio.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"Nay, I'll conjure too.","book 4"
"Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!","book 4"

"When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!","book 4"
"He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;","book 4"
"The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.","book 4"
"I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,","book 4"
"By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,","book 4"
"By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh","book 4"
"And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,","book 4"
"That in thy likeness thou appear to us!","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him","book 4"
"To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle","book 4"
"Of some strange nature, letting it there stand","book 4"
"Till she had laid it and conjured it down;","book 4"
"That were some spite: my invocation","book 4"
"Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name","book 4"
"I conjure only but to raise up him.","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,","book 4"
"To be consorted with the humorous night:","book 4"
"Blind is his love and best befits the dark.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.","book 4"
"Now will he sit under a medlar tree,","book 4"
"And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit","book 4"
"As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.","book 4"
"Romeo, that she were, O, that she were","book 4"
"An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!","book 4"
"Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;","book 4"
"This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:","book 4"
"Come, shall we go?","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"Go, then; for 'tis in vain","book 4"
"To seek him here that means not to be found.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"He jests at scars that never felt a wound.","book 4"
"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?","book 4"
"It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.","book 4"
"Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,","book 4"
"Who is already sick and pale with grief,","book 4"
"That thou her maid art far more fair than she:","book 4"
"Be not her maid, since she is envious;","book 4"
"Her vestal livery is but sick and green","book 4"
"And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.","book 4"
"It is my lady, O, it is my love!","book 4"
"O, that she knew she were!","book 4"
"She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?","book 4"
"Her eye discourses; I will answer it.","book 4"
"I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:","book 4"
"Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,","book 4"
"Having some business, do entreat her eyes","book 4"
"To twinkle in their spheres till they return.","book 4"
"What if her eyes were there, they in her head?","book 4"
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,","book 4"
"As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven","book 4"
"Would through the airy region stream so bright","book 4"
"That birds would sing and think it were not night.","book 4"
"See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!","book 4"
"O, that I were a glove upon that hand,","book 4"
"That I might touch that cheek!","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Ay me!","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"She speaks:","book 4"
"O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art","book 4"
"As glorious to this night, being o'er my head","book 4"
"As is a winged messenger of heaven","book 4"
"Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes","book 4"
"Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him","book 4"
"When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds","book 4"
"And sails upon the bosom of the air.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?","book 4"
"Deny thy father and refuse thy name;","book 4"
"Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,","book 4"
"And I'll no longer be a Capulet.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;","book 4"
"Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.","book 4"
"What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,","book 4"
"Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part","book 4"
"Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!","book 4"
"What's in a name? that which we call a rose","book 4"
"By any other name would smell as sweet;","book 4"
"So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,","book 4"
"Retain that dear perfection which he owes","book 4"
"Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,","book 4"
"And for that name which is no part of thee","book 4"
"Take all myself.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"I take thee at thy word:","book 4"
"Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;","book 4"
"Henceforth I never will be Romeo.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night","book 4"
"So stumblest on my counsel?","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"By a name","book 4"
"I know not how to tell thee who I am:","book 4"
"My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,","book 4"
"Because it is an enemy to thee;","book 4"
"Had I it written, I would tear the word.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words","book 4"
"Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:","book 4"
"Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?","book 4"
"The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,","book 4"
"And the place death, considering who thou art,","book 4"
"If any of my kinsmen find thee here.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;","book 4"
"For stony limits cannot hold love out,","book 4"
"And what love can do that dares love attempt;","book 4"
"Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"If they do see thee, they will murder thee.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye","book 4"
"Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,","book 4"
"And I am proof against their enmity.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"I would not for the world they saw thee here.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;","book 4"
"And but thou love me, let them find me here:","book 4"
"My life were better ended by their hate,","book 4"
"Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"By whose direction found'st thou out this place?","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;","book 4"
"He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.","book 4"
"I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far","book 4"
"As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,","book 4"
"I would adventure for such merchandise.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,","book 4"
"Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek","book 4"
"For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night","book 4"
"Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny","book 4"
"What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!","book 4"
"Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'","book 4"
"And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,","book 4"
"Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries","book 4"
"Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,","book 4"
"If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:","book 4"
"Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,","book 4"
"I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,","book 4"
"So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.","book 4"
"In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,","book 4"
"And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:","book 4"
"But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true","book 4"
"Than those that have more cunning to be strange.","book 4"
"I should have been more strange, I must confess,","book 4"
"But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,","book 4"
"My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,","book 4"
"And not impute this yielding to light love,","book 4"
"Which the dark night hath so discovered.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear","book 4"
"That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,","book 4"
"That monthly changes in her circled orb,","book 4"
"Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"What shall I swear by?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Do not swear at all;","book 4"
"Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,","book 4"
"Which is the god of my idolatry,","book 4"
"And I'll believe thee.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"If my heart's dear love--","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,","book 4"
"I have no joy of this contract to-night:","book 4"
"It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;","book 4"
"Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be","book 4"
"Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!","book 4"
"This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,","book 4"
"May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.","book 4"
"Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest","book 4"
"Come to thy heart as that within my breast!","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:","book 4"
"And yet I would it were to give again.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"But to be frank, and give it thee again.","book 4"
"And yet I wish but for the thing I have:","book 4"
"My bounty is as boundless as the sea,","book 4"
"My love as deep; the more I give to thee,","book 4"
"The more I have, for both are infinite.","book 4"
"I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!","book 4"
"Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.","book 4"
"Stay but a little, I will come again.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"

"Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.","book 4"
"O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,","book 4"
"Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,","book 4"
"Driving back shadows over louring hills:","book 4"
"Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,","book 4"
"And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.","book 4"
"Now is the sun upon the highmost hill","book 4"
"Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve","book 4"
"Is three long hours, yet she is not come.","book 4"
"Had she affections and warm youthful blood,","book 4"
"She would be as swift in motion as a ball;","book 4"
"My words would bandy her to my sweet love,","book 4"
"And his to me:","book 4"
"But old folks, many feign as they were dead;","book 4"
"Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.","book 4"
"O God, she comes!","book 4"
"O honey nurse, what news?","book 4"
"Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Peter, stay at the gate.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?","book 4"
"Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;","book 4"
"If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news","book 4"
"By playing it to me with so sour a face.","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:","book 4"
"Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:","book 4"
"Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?","book 4"
"Do you not see that I am out of breath?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath","book 4"
"To say to me that thou art out of breath?","book 4"
"The excuse that thou dost make in this delay","book 4"
"Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.","book 4"
"Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;","book 4"
"Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:","book 4"
"Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not","book 4"
"how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his","book 4"
"face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels","book 4"
"all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,","book 4"
"though they be not to be talked on, yet they are","book 4"
"past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,","book 4"
"but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy","book 4"
"ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"No, no: but all this did I know before.","book 4"
"What says he of our marriage? what of that?","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!","book 4"
"It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.","book 4"
"My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!","book 4"
"Beshrew your heart for sending me about,","book 4"
"To catch my death with jaunting up and down!","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.","book 4"
"Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a","book 4"
"courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I","book 4"
"warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Where is my mother! why, she is within;","book 4"
"Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!","book 4"
"'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,","book 4"
"Where is your mother?'","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"O God's lady dear!","book 4"
"Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;","book 4"
"Is this the poultice for my aching bones?","book 4"
"Henceforward do your messages yourself.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"I have.","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;","book 4"
"There stays a husband to make you a wife:","book 4"
"Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,","book 4"
"They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.","book 4"
"Hie you to church; I must another way,","book 4"
"To fetch a ladder, by the which your love","book 4"
"Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:","book 4"
"I am the drudge and toil in your delight,","book 4"
"But you shall bear the burden soon at night.","book 4"
"Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"So smile the heavens upon this holy act,","book 4"
"That after hours with sorrow chide us not!","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,","book 4"
"It cannot countervail the exchange of joy","book 4"
"That one short minute gives me in her sight:","book 4"
"Do thou but close our hands with holy words,","book 4"
"Then love-devouring death do what he dare;","book 4"
"It is enough I may but call her mine.","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"These violent delights have violent ends","book 4"
"And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,","book 4"
"Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey","book 4"
"Is loathsome in his own deliciousness","book 4"
"And in the taste confounds the appetite:","book 4"
"Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;","book 4"
"Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.","book 4"
"Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot","book 4"
"Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:","book 4"
"A lover may bestride the gossamer","book 4"
"That idles in the wanton summer air,","book 4"
"And yet not fall; so light is vanity.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Good even to my ghostly confessor.","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"As much to him, else is his thanks too much.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy","book 4"
"Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more","book 4"
"To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath","book 4"
"This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue","book 4"
"Unfold the imagined happiness that both","book 4"
"Receive in either by this dear encounter.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,","book 4"
"Brags of his substance, not of ornament:","book 4"
"They are but beggars that can count their worth;","book 4"
"But my true love is grown to such excess","book 4"
"I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"Come, come with me, and we will make short work;","book 4"
"For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone","book 4"
"Till holy church incorporate two in one.","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:","book 4"
"The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,","book 4"
"And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;","book 4"
"For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"Thou art like one of those fellows that when he","book 4"
"enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword","book 4"
"upon the table and says 'God send me no need of","book 4"
"thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws","book 4"
"it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"Am I like such a fellow?","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as","book 4"
"any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as","book 4"
"soon moody to be moved.","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"And what to?","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"Nay, an there were two such, we should have none","book 4"
"shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,","book 4"
"thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,","book 4"
"or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou","book 4"
"wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no","book 4"
"other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what","book 4"
"eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?","book 4"
"Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of","book 4"
"meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as","book 4"
"an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a","book 4"
"man for coughing in the street, because he hath","book 4"
"wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:","book 4"
"didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing","book 4"
"his new doublet before Easter? with another, for","book 4"
"tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou","book 4"
"wilt tutor me from quarrelling!","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man","book 4"
"should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"The fee-simple! O simple!","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"By my head, here come the Capulets.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"By my heel, I care not.","book 4"
"TYBALT:","book 4"
"Follow me close, for I will speak to them.","book 4"
"Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"And but one word with one of us? couple it with","book 4"
"something; make it a word and a blow.","book 4"
"TYBALT:","book 4"
"You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you","book 4"
"will give me occasion.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"Could you not take some occasion without giving?","book 4"
"TYBALT:","book 4"
"Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an","book 4"
"thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but","book 4"
"discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall","book 4"
"make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"We talk here in the public haunt of men:","book 4"
"Either withdraw unto some private place,","book 4"
"And reason coldly of your grievances,","book 4"
"Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;","book 4"
"I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.","book 4"
"TYBALT:","book 4"
"Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:","book 4"
"Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;","book 4"
"Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'","book 4"
"TYBALT:","book 4"
"Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford","book 4"
"No better term than this,--thou art a villain.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee","book 4"
"Doth much excuse the appertaining rage","book 4"
"To such a greeting: villain am I none;","book 4"
"Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.","book 4"
"TYBALT:","book 4"
"Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries","book 4"
"That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"I do protest, I never injured thee,","book 4"
"But love thee better than thou canst devise,","book 4"
"Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:","book 4"
"And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender","book 4"
"As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!","book 4"
"Alla stoccata carries it away.","book 4"
"Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?","book 4"
"TYBALT:","book 4"
"What wouldst thou have with me?","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine","book 4"
"lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you","book 4"
"shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the","book 4"
"eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher","book 4"
"by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your","book 4"
"ears ere it be out.","book 4"
"TYBALT:","book 4"
"I am for you.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"Come, sir, your passado.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.","book 4"
"Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!","book 4"
"Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath","book 4"
"Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:","book 4"
"Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"I am hurt.","book 4"
"A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.","book 4"
"Is he gone, and hath nothing?","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"What, art thou hurt?","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.","book 4"
"Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a","book 4"
"church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for","book 4"
"me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I","book 4"
"am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'","book 4"
"both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a","book 4"
"cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a","book 4"
"rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of","book 4"
"arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I","book 4"
"was hurt under your arm.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"I thought all for the best.","book 4"
"MERCUTIO:","book 4"
"Help me into some house, Benvolio,","book 4"
"Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!","book 4"
"They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,","book 4"
"And soundly too: your houses!","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"This gentleman, the prince's near ally,","book 4"
"My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt","book 4"
"In my behalf; my reputation stain'd","book 4"
"With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour","book 4"
"Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,","book 4"
"Thy beauty hath made me effeminate","book 4"
"And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!","book 4"
"That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,","book 4"
"Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"This day's black fate on more days doth depend;","book 4"
"This but begins the woe, others must end.","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!","book 4"
"Away to heaven, respective lenity,","book 4"
"And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!","book 4"
"Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,","book 4"
"That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul","book 4"
"Is but a little way above our heads,","book 4"
"Staying for thine to keep him company:","book 4"
"Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.","book 4"
"TYBALT:","book 4"
"Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,","book 4"
"Shalt with him hence.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"This shall determine that.","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"Romeo, away, be gone!","book 4"
"The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.","book 4"
"Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,","book 4"
"If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"O, I am fortune's fool!","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"Why dost thou stay?","book 4"
"First Citizen:","book 4"
"Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?","book 4"
"Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"There lies that Tybalt.","book 4"
"First Citizen:","book 4"
"Up, sir, go with me;","book 4"
"I charge thee in the princes name, obey.","book 4"
"PRINCE:","book 4"
"Where are the vile beginners of this fray?","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"O noble prince, I can discover all","book 4"
"The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:","book 4"
"There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,","book 4"
"That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!","book 4"
"O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt","book 4"
"O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,","book 4"
"For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.","book 4"
"O cousin, cousin!","book 4"
"PRINCE:","book 4"
"Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?","book 4"
"BENVOLIO:","book 4"
"Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;","book 4"
"Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink","book 4"
"How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal","book 4"
"Your high displeasure: all this uttered","book 4"
"With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,","book 4"
"Could not take truce with the unruly spleen","book 4"
"Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts","book 4"
"With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,","book 4"
"Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,","book 4"
"And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats","book 4"
"Cold death aside, and with the other sends","book 4"
"It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,","book 4"
"Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,","book 4"
"'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than","book 4"
"his tongue,","book 4"
"His agile arm beats down their fatal points,","book 4"
"And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm","book 4"
"An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life","book 4"
"Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;","book 4"
"But by and by comes back to Romeo,","book 4"
"Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,","book 4"
"And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I","book 4"
"Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.","book 4"
"And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.","book 4"
"This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"He is a kinsman to the Montague;","book 4"
"Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:","book 4"
"Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,","book 4"
"And all those twenty could but kill one life.","book 4"
"I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;","book 4"
"Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.","book 4"
"PRINCE:","book 4"
"Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;","book 4"
"Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?","book 4"
"MONTAGUE:","book 4"
"Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;","book 4"
"His fault concludes but what the law should end,","book 4"
"The life of Tybalt.","book 4"
"PRINCE:","book 4"
"And for that offence","book 4"
"Immediately we do exile him hence:","book 4"
"I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,","book 4"
"My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;","book 4"
"But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine","book 4"
"That you shall all repent the loss of mine:","book 4"
"I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;","book 4"
"Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:","book 4"
"Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,","book 4"
"Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.","book 4"
"Bear hence this body and attend our will:","book 4"
"Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,","book 4"
"Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner","book 4"
"As Phaethon would whip you to the west,","book 4"
"And bring in cloudy night immediately.","book 4"
"Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,","book 4"
"That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo","book 4"
"Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.","book 4"
"Lovers can see to do their amorous rites","book 4"
"By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,","book 4"
"It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,","book 4"
"Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,","book 4"
"And learn me how to lose a winning match,","book 4"
"Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:","book 4"
"Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,","book 4"
"With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,","book 4"
"Think true love acted simple modesty.","book 4"
"Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;","book 4"
"For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night","book 4"
"Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.","book 4"
"Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,","book 4"
"Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,","book 4"
"Take him and cut him out in little stars,","book 4"
"And he will make the face of heaven so fine","book 4"
"That all the world will be in love with night","book 4"
"And pay no worship to the garish sun.","book 4"
"O, I have bought the mansion of a love,","book 4"
"But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,","book 4"
"Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day","book 4"
"As is the night before some festival","book 4"
"To an impatient child that hath new robes","book 4"
"And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,","book 4"
"And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks","book 4"
"But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.","book 4"
"Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords","book 4"
"That Romeo bid thee fetch?","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Ay, ay, the cords.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!","book 4"
"We are undone, lady, we are undone!","book 4"
"Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!","book 4"

"Can heaven be so envious?","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Romeo can,","book 4"
"Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!","book 4"
"Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?","book 4"
"This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.","book 4"
"Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'","book 4"
"And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more","book 4"
"Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:","book 4"
"I am not I, if there be such an I;","book 4"
"Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'","book 4"
"If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:","book 4"
"Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--","book 4"
"God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:","book 4"
"A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;","book 4"
"Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,","book 4"
"All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.","book 4"

"Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,","book 4"
"Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:","book 4"

"ROMEO:","book 4"
"How well my comfort is revived by this!","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:","book 4"

"Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,","book 4"

"Every good hap to you that chances here:","book 4"
"Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.","book 4"

"It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"

"She shall be married to this noble earl.","book 4"
"Will you be ready? do you like this haste?","book 4"

"For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,","book 4"
"It may be thought we held him carelessly,","book 4"

"Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:","book 4"

"Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.","book 4"
"ROMEO:","book 4"
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn,","book 4"
"No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks","book 4"
"Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:","book 4"
"Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day","book 4"

"How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!","book 4"
"It is the lark that sings so out of tune,","book 4"
"Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.","book 4"
"Some say the lark makes sweet division;","book 4"
"This doth not so, for she divideth us:","book 4"
"Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,","book 4"

"JULIET:","book 4"
"What villain madam?","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"That same villain, Romeo.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"That is, because the traitor murderer lives.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:","book 4"
"Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:","book 4"
"Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,","book 4"
"Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,","book 4"
"Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,","book 4"
"That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:","book 4"
"And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Indeed, I never shall be satisfied","book 4"
"With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--","book 4"
"Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.","book 4"
"Madam, if you could find out but a man","book 4"
"To bear a poison, I would temper it;","book 4"
"That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,","book 4"
"Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors","book 4"
"To hear him named, and cannot come to him.","book 4"
"To wreak the love I bore my cousin","book 4"
"Upon his body that slaughter'd him!","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.","book 4"
"But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"And joy comes well in such a needy time:","book 4"
"What are they, I beseech your ladyship?","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;","book 4"
"One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,","book 4"
"Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,","book 4"
"That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Madam, in happy time, what day is that?","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,","book 4"
"The gallant, young and noble gentleman,","book 4"
"The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,","book 4"
"Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,","book 4"
"He shall not make me there a joyful bride.","book 4"
"I wonder at this haste; that I must wed","book 4"
"Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.","book 4"
"I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,","book 4"
"I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,","book 4"
"It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,","book 4"
"Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,","book 4"
"And see how he will take it at your hands.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;","book 4"
"But for the sunset of my brother's son","book 4"
"It rains downright.","book 4"
"How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?","book 4"
"Evermore showering? In one little body","book 4"
"Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;","book 4"
"For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,","book 4"
"Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,","book 4"
"Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;","book 4"
"Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,","book 4"
"Without a sudden calm, will overset","book 4"
"Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!","book 4"
"Have you deliver'd to her our decree?","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.","book 4"
"I would the fool were married to her grave!","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.","book 4"
"How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?","book 4"
"Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,","book 4"
"Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought","book 4"
"So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:","book 4"
"Proud can I never be of what I hate;","book 4"
"But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?","book 4"
"'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'","book 4"
"And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,","book 4"
"Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,","book 4"
"But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,","book 4"
"To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,","book 4"
"Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.","book 4"
"Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!","book 4"
"You tallow-face!","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"Fie, fie! what, are you mad?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Good father, I beseech you on my knees,","book 4"
"Hear me with patience but to speak a word.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!","book 4"
"I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,","book 4"
"Or never after look me in the face:","book 4"
"Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;","book 4"
"My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest","book 4"
"That God had lent us but this only child;","book 4"
"But now I see this one is one too much,","book 4"
"And that we have a curse in having her:","book 4"
"Out on her, hilding!","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"God in heaven bless her!","book 4"
"You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,","book 4"
"Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"I speak no treason.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"O, God ye god-den.","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"May not one speak?","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"Peace, you mumbling fool!","book 4"
"Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;","book 4"
"For here we need it not.","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"You are too hot.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"God's bread! it makes me mad:","book 4"
"Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,","book 4"
"Alone, in company, still my care hath been","book 4"
"To have her match'd: and having now provided","book 4"
"A gentleman of noble parentage,","book 4"
"Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,","book 4"
"Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,","book 4"
"Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;","book 4"
"And then to have a wretched puling fool,","book 4"
"A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,","book 4"
"To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,","book 4"
"I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'","book 4"
"But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:","book 4"
"Graze where you will you shall not house with me:","book 4"
"Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.","book 4"
"Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:","book 4"
"An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;","book 4"
"And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in","book 4"
"the streets,","book 4"
"For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,","book 4"
"Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:","book 4"
"Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,","book 4"
"That sees into the bottom of my grief?","book 4"
"O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!","book 4"
"Delay this marriage for a month, a week;","book 4"
"Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed","book 4"
"In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:","book 4"
"Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?","book 4"
"My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;","book 4"
"How shall that faith return again to earth,","book 4"
"Unless that husband send it me from heaven","book 4"
"By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.","book 4"
"Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems","book 4"
"Upon so soft a subject as myself!","book 4"
"What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?","book 4"
"Some comfort, nurse.","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Faith, here it is.","book 4"
"Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,","book 4"
"That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;","book 4"
"Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.","book 4"
"Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,","book 4"
"I think it best you married with the county.","book 4"
"O, he's a lovely gentleman!","book 4"
"Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,","book 4"
"Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye","book 4"
"As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,","book 4"
"I think you are happy in this second match,","book 4"
"For it excels your first: or if it did not,","book 4"
"Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,","book 4"
"As living here and you no use of him.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Speakest thou from thy heart?","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"And from my soul too;","book 4"
"Or else beshrew them both.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Amen!","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"What?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.","book 4"
"Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,","book 4"
"Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,","book 4"
"To make confession and to be absolved.","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!","book 4"
"Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,","book 4"
"Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue","book 4"
"Which she hath praised him with above compare","book 4"
"So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;","book 4"
"Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.","book 4"
"I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:","book 4"
"If all else fail, myself have power to die.","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.","book 4"
"PARIS:","book 4"
"My father Capulet will have it so;","book 4"
"And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"You say you do not know the lady's mind:","book 4"
"Uneven is the course, I like it not.","book 4"
"PARIS:","book 4"
"Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,","book 4"
"And therefore have I little talk'd of love;","book 4"
"For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.","book 4"
"Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous","book 4"
"That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,","book 4"
"And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,","book 4"
"To stop the inundation of her tears;","book 4"
"Which, too much minded by herself alone,","book 4"
"May be put from her by society:","book 4"
"Now do you know the reason of this haste.","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"PARIS:","book 4"
"Happily met, my lady and my wife!","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.","book 4"
"PARIS:","book 4"
"That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"What must be shall be.","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"That's a certain text.","book 4"
"PARIS:","book 4"
"Come you to make confession to this father?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"To answer that, I should confess to you.","book 4"
"PARIS:","book 4"
"Do not deny to him that you love me.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"I will confess to you that I love him.","book 4"
"PARIS:","book 4"
"So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"If I do so, it will be of more price,","book 4"
"Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.","book 4"
"PARIS:","book 4"
"Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"The tears have got small victory by that;","book 4"
"For it was bad enough before their spite.","book 4"
"PARIS:","book 4"
"Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;","book 4"
"And what I spake, I spake it to my face.","book 4"
"PARIS:","book 4"
"Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"It may be so, for it is not mine own.","book 4"
"Are you at leisure, holy father, now;","book 4"
"Or shall I come to you at evening mass?","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.","book 4"
"My lord, we must entreat the time alone.","book 4"
"PARIS:","book 4"
"God shield I should disturb devotion!","book 4"
"Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:","book 4"
"Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,","book 4"
"Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;","book 4"
"It strains me past the compass of my wits:","book 4"
"I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,","book 4"
"On Thursday next be married to this county.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,","book 4"
"Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:","book 4"
"If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,","book 4"
"Do thou but call my resolution wise,","book 4"
"And with this knife I'll help it presently.","book 4"
"God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;","book 4"
"And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,","book 4"
"Shall be the label to another deed,","book 4"
"Or my true heart with treacherous revolt","book 4"
"Turn to another, this shall slay them both:","book 4"
"Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,","book 4"
"Give me some present counsel, or, behold,","book 4"
"'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife","book 4"
"Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that","book 4"
"Which the commission of thy years and art","book 4"
"Could to no issue of true honour bring.","book 4"
"Be not so long to speak; I long to die,","book 4"
"If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,","book 4"
"Which craves as desperate an execution.","book 4"
"As that is desperate which we would prevent.","book 4"
"If, rather than to marry County Paris,","book 4"
"Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,","book 4"
"Then is it likely thou wilt undertake","book 4"
"A thing like death to chide away this shame,","book 4"
"That copest with death himself to scape from it:","book 4"
"And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,","book 4"
"From off the battlements of yonder tower;","book 4"
"Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk","book 4"
"Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;","book 4"
"Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,","book 4"
"O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,","book 4"
"With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;","book 4"
"Or bid me go into a new-made grave","book 4"
"And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;","book 4"
"Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;","book 4"
"And I will do it without fear or doubt,","book 4"
"To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent","book 4"
"To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:","book 4"
"To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;","book 4"
"Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:","book 4"
"Take thou this vial, being then in bed,","book 4"
"And this distilled liquor drink thou off;","book 4"
"When presently through all thy veins shall run","book 4"
"A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse","book 4"
"Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:","book 4"
"No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;","book 4"
"The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade","book 4"
"To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,","book 4"
"Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;","book 4"
"Each part, deprived of supple government,","book 4"
"Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:","book 4"
"And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death","book 4"
"Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,","book 4"
"And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.","book 4"
"Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes","book 4"
"To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:","book 4"
"Then, as the manner of our country is,","book 4"
"In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier","book 4"
"Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault","book 4"
"Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.","book 4"
"In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,","book 4"
"Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,","book 4"
"And hither shall he come: and he and I","book 4"
"Will watch thy waking, and that very night","book 4"
"Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.","book 4"
"And this shall free thee from this present shame;","book 4"
"If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,","book 4"
"Abate thy valour in the acting it.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!","book 4"
"FRIAR LAURENCE:","book 4"
"Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous","book 4"
"In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed","book 4"
"To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.","book 4"
"Farewell, dear father!","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"So many guests invite as here are writ.","book 4"
"Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.","book 4"
"Second Servant:","book 4"
"You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they","book 4"
"can lick their fingers.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"How canst thou try them so?","book 4"
"Second Servant:","book 4"
"Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his","book 4"
"own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his","book 4"
"fingers goes not with me.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"Go, be gone.","book 4"
"We shall be much unfurnished for this time.","book 4"
"What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"Ay, forsooth.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"Well, he may chance to do some good on her:","book 4"
"A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.","book 4"
"Nurse:","book 4"
"See where she comes from shrift with merry look.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin","book 4"
"Of disobedient opposition","book 4"
"To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd","book 4"
"By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,","book 4"
"And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!","book 4"
"Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"Send for the county; go tell him of this:","book 4"
"I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;","book 4"
"And gave him what becomed love I might,","book 4"
"Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:","book 4"
"This is as't should be. Let me see the county;","book 4"
"Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.","book 4"
"Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,","book 4"
"Our whole city is much bound to him.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,","book 4"
"To help me sort such needful ornaments","book 4"
"As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.","book 4"
"LADY  CAPULET:","book 4"
"We shall be short in our provision:","book 4"
"'Tis now near night.","book 4"
"CAPULET:","book 4"
"Tush, I will stir about,","book 4"
"And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:","book 4"
"Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;","book 4"
"I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;","book 4"
"I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!","book 4"
"They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself","book 4"
"To County Paris, to prepare him up","book 4"
"Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,","book 4"
"Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,","book 4"
"I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,","book 4"
"For I have need of many orisons","book 4"
"To move the heavens to smile upon my state,","book 4"
"Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries","book 4"
"As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:","book 4"
"So please you, let me now be left alone,","book 4"
"And let the nurse this night sit up with you;","book 4"
"For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,","book 4"
"In this so sudden business.","book 4"
"LADY CAPULET:","book 4"
"Good night:","book 4"
"Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.","book 4"
"JULIET:","book 4"
"Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.","book 4"
"I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,","book 4"
"That almost freezes up the heat of life:","book 4"
"I'll call them back again to comfort me:","book 4"
"Nurse! What should she do here?","book 4"
"My dismal scene I needs must act alone.","book 4"
"Come, vial.","book 4"
"What if this mixture do not work at all?","book 4"
"Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?","book 4"
"No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.","book 4"
"What if it be a poison, which the friar","book 4"
"Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,","book 4"
"Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,","book 4"
"Because he married me before to Romeo?","book 4"
"I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,","book 4"
"For he hath still been tried a holy man.","book 4"
"How if, when I am laid into the tomb,","book 4"
"I wake before the time that Romeo","book 4"
"Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!","book 4"
"Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,","book 4"
"To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,","book 4"

"Well, sir, what answer made the belly?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,","book 5"
"Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--","book 5"
"For, look you, I may make the belly smile","book 5"
"As well as speak--it tauntingly replied","book 5"

"'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,","book 5"
"'That I receive the general food at first,","book 5"
"Which you do live upon; and fit it is,","book 5"
"Because I am the store-house and the shop","book 5"

"And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"It was an answer: how apply you this?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"The senators of Rome are this good belly,","book 5"
"And you the mutinous members; for examine","book 5"
"Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly","book 5"
"Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find","book 5"
"No public benefit which you receive","book 5"
"But it proceeds or comes from them to you","book 5"
"And no way from yourselves. What do you think,","book 5"
"You, the great toe of this assembly?","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"I the great toe! why the great toe?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,","book 5"
"Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:","book 5"
"Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,","book 5"
"Lead'st first to win some vantage.","book 5"
"But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:","book 5"
"Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;","book 5"
"The one side must have bale.","book 5"
"Hail, noble Marcius!","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,","book 5"
"That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,","book 5"
"Make yourselves scabs?","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"We have ever your good word.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"He that will give good words to thee will flatter","book 5"
"Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,","book 5"
"That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,","book 5"
"The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,","book 5"
"Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;","book 5"
"Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,","book 5"
"Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,","book 5"
"Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is","book 5"
"To make him worthy whose offence subdues him","book 5"
"And curse that justice did it.","book 5"
"Who deserves greatness","book 5"
"Deserves your hate; and your affections are","book 5"
"A sick man's appetite, who desires most that","book 5"
"Which would increase his evil. He that depends","book 5"
"Upon your favours swims with fins of lead","book 5"
"And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?","book 5"
"With every minute you do change a mind,","book 5"
"And call him noble that was now your hate,","book 5"
"Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,","book 5"
"That in these several places of the city","book 5"
"You cry against the noble senate, who,","book 5"
"Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else","book 5"
"Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,","book 5"
"The city is well stored.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Hang 'em! They say!","book 5"
"They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know","book 5"
"What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,","book 5"
"Who thrives and who declines; side factions","book 5"
"and give out","book 5"
"Conjectural marriages; making parties strong","book 5"
"And feebling such as stand not in their liking","book 5"
"Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's","book 5"
"grain enough!","book 5"
"Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,","book 5"
"And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry","book 5"
"With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high","book 5"
"As I could pick my lance.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;","book 5"
"For though abundantly they lack discretion,","book 5"
"Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,","book 5"
"What says the other troop?","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"They are dissolved: hang 'em!","book 5"
"They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,","book 5"
"That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,","book 5"
"That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not","book 5"
"Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds","book 5"
"They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,","book 5"
"And a petition granted them, a strange one--","book 5"
"To break the heart of generosity,","book 5"
"And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps","book 5"
"As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,","book 5"
"Shouting their emulation.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"What is granted them?","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,","book 5"
"Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,","book 5"
"Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!","book 5"
"The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,","book 5"
"Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time","book 5"
"Win upon power and throw forth greater themes","book 5"
"For insurrection's arguing.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"This is strange.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Go, get you home, you fragments!","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"Where's Caius Marcius?","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Here: what's the matter?","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent","book 5"
"Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;","book 5"
"The Volsces are in arms.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"They have a leader,","book 5"
"Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.","book 5"
"I sin in envying his nobility,","book 5"
"And were I any thing but what I am,","book 5"
"I would wish me only he.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"You have fought together.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Were half to half the world by the ears and he.","book 5"
"Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make","book 5"
"Only my wars with him: he is a lion","book 5"
"That I am proud to hunt.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Then, worthy Marcius,","book 5"
"Attend upon Cominius to these wars.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"It is your former promise.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Sir, it is;","book 5"
"And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou","book 5"
"Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.","book 5"
"What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?","book 5"
"TITUS:","book 5"
"No, Caius Marcius;","book 5"
"I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,","book 5"
"Ere stay behind this business.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"O, true-bred!","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,","book 5"
"Our greatest friends attend us.","book 5"
"TITUS:","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Noble Marcius!","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Nay, let them follow:","book 5"
"The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither","book 5"
"To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,","book 5"
"Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"He has no equal.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Mark'd you his lip and eyes?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Nay. but his taunts.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Be-mock the modest moon.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"The present wars devour him: he is grown","book 5"
"Too proud to be so valiant.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Such a nature,","book 5"
"Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow","book 5"
"Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder","book 5"
"His insolence can brook to be commanded","book 5"
"Under Cominius.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Fame, at the which he aims,","book 5"
"In whom already he's well graced, can not","book 5"
"Better be held nor more attain'd than by","book 5"
"A place below the first: for what miscarries","book 5"
"Shall be the general's fault, though he perform","book 5"
"To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure","book 5"
"Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he","book 5"
"Had borne the business!'","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Besides, if things go well,","book 5"
"Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall","book 5"
"Of his demerits rob Cominius.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Come:","book 5"
"Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.","book 5"
"Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults","book 5"
"To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed","book 5"
"In aught he merit not.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Let's hence, and hear","book 5"
"How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,","book 5"
"More than his singularity, he goes","book 5"
"Upon this present action.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Lets along.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"So, your opinion is, Aufidius,","book 5"
"That they of Rome are entered in our counsels","book 5"
"And know how we proceed.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Is it not yours?","book 5"
"What ever have been thought on in this state,","book 5"
"That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome","book 5"
"Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone","book 5"
"Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think","book 5"
"I have the letter here; yes, here it is.","book 5"
"'They have press'd a power, but it is not known","book 5"
"Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;","book 5"
"The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,","book 5"
"Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,","book 5"
"Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,","book 5"
"And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,","book 5"
"These three lead on this preparation","book 5"
"Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:","book 5"
"Consider of it.'","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Our army's in the field","book 5"
"We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready","book 5"
"To answer us.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Nor did you think it folly","book 5"
"To keep your great pretences veil'd till when","book 5"
"They needs must show themselves; which","book 5"
"in the hatching,","book 5"
"It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.","book 5"
"We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was","book 5"
"To take in many towns ere almost Rome","book 5"
"Should know we were afoot.","book 5"
"Second Senator:","book 5"
"Noble Aufidius,","book 5"
"Take your commission; hie you to your bands:","book 5"
"Let us alone to guard Corioli:","book 5"
"If they set down before 's, for the remove","book 5"
"Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find","book 5"
"They've not prepared for us.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"O, doubt not that;","book 5"
"I speak from certainties. Nay, more,","book 5"
"Some parcels of their power are forth already,","book 5"
"And only hitherward. I leave your honours.","book 5"
"If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,","book 5"
"'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike","book 5"
"Till one can do no more.","book 5"
"All:","book 5"
"The gods assist you!","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"And keep your honours safe!","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Farewell.","book 5"
"Second Senator:","book 5"
"Farewell.","book 5"
"All:","book 5"
"Farewell.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a","book 5"
"more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I","book 5"
"should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he","book 5"
"won honour than in the embracements of his bed where","book 5"
"he would show most love. When yet he was but","book 5"
"tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when","book 5"
"youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when","book 5"
"for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not","book 5"
"sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering","book 5"
"how honour would become such a person. that it was","book 5"
"no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if","book 5"
"renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek","book 5"
"danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel","book 5"
"war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows","book 5"
"bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not","book 5"
"more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child","book 5"
"than now in first seeing he had proved himself a","book 5"
"man.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"But had he died in the business, madam; how then?","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Then his good report should have been my son; I","book 5"
"therein would have found issue. Hear me profess","book 5"
"sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love","book 5"
"alike and none less dear than thine and my good","book 5"
"Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their","book 5"
"country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.","book 5"
"Gentlewoman:","book 5"
"Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Indeed, you shall not.","book 5"
"Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,","book 5"
"See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,","book 5"
"As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:","book 5"
"Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:","book 5"
"'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,","book 5"
"Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow","book 5"
"With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,","book 5"
"Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow","book 5"
"Or all or lose his hire.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Away, you fool! it more becomes a man","book 5"
"Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,","book 5"
"When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier","book 5"
"Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood","book 5"
"At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,","book 5"
"We are fit to bid her welcome.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee","book 5"
"And tread upon his neck.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"My ladies both, good day to you.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Sweet madam.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"I am glad to see your ladyship.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.","book 5"
"What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good","book 5"
"faith. How does your little son?","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than","book 5"
"look upon his school-master.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a","book 5"
"very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'","book 5"
"Wednesday half an hour together: has such a","book 5"
"confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded","book 5"
"butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go","book 5"
"again; and after it again; and over and over he","book 5"
"comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his","book 5"
"fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his","book 5"
"teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked","book 5"
"it!","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"One on 's father's moods.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"A crack, madam.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play","book 5"
"the idle husewife with me this afternoon.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"No, good madam; I will not out of doors.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"Not out of doors!","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"She shall, she shall.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the","book 5"
"threshold till my lord return from the wars.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,","book 5"
"you must go visit the good lady that lies in.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with","book 5"
"my prayers; but I cannot go thither.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Why, I pray you?","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all","book 5"
"the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill","book 5"
"Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric","book 5"
"were sensible as your finger, that you might leave","book 5"
"pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you","book 5"
"excellent news of your husband.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"O, good madam, there can be none yet.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from","book 5"
"him last night.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"Indeed, madam?","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.","book 5"
"Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against","book 5"
"whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of","book 5"
"our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set","book 5"
"down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt","book 5"
"prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,","book 5"
"on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every","book 5"
"thing hereafter.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but","book 5"
"disease our better mirth.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.","book 5"
"Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy","book 5"
"solemness out o' door. and go along with us.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish","book 5"
"you much mirth.","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"Well, then, farewell.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"My horse to yours, no.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"'Tis done.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"Agreed.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Say, has our general met the enemy?","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"So, the good horse is mine.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"I'll buy him of you.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will","book 5"
"For half a hundred years. Summon the town.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"How far off lie these armies?","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"Within this mile and half.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.","book 5"
"Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,","book 5"
"That we with smoking swords may march from hence,","book 5"
"To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.","book 5"
"Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"No, nor a man that fears you less than he,","book 5"
"That's lesser than a little.","book 5"
"Hark! our drums","book 5"
"Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,","book 5"
"Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,","book 5"
"Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;","book 5"
"They'll open of themselves.","book 5"
"Hark you. far off!","book 5"
"There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes","book 5"
"Amongst your cloven army.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"O, they are at it!","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"They fear us not, but issue forth their city.","book 5"
"Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight","book 5"
"With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,","book 5"
"brave Titus:","book 5"
"They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,","book 5"
"Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:","book 5"
"He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,","book 5"
"And he shall feel mine edge.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"All the contagion of the south light on you,","book 5"
"You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues","book 5"
"Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd","book 5"
"Further than seen and one infect another","book 5"
"Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,","book 5"
"That bear the shapes of men, how have you run","book 5"
"From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!","book 5"
"All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale","book 5"
"With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,","book 5"
"Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe","book 5"
"And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;","book 5"
"If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,","book 5"
"As they us to our trenches followed.","book 5"
"So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:","book 5"
"'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,","book 5"
"Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.","book 5"

"See, they have shut him in.","book 5"
"All:","book 5"
"To the pot, I warrant him.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"What is become of Marcius?","book 5"
"All:","book 5"
"Slain, sir, doubtless.","book 5"
"First Soldier:","book 5"
"Following the fliers at the very heels,","book 5"
"With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,","book 5"
"Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,","book 5"
"To answer all the city.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"O noble fellow!","book 5"
"Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,","book 5"
"And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:","book 5"
"A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,","book 5"
"Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier","book 5"
"Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible","book 5"
"Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and","book 5"
"The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,","book 5"
"Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world","book 5"
"Were feverous and did tremble.","book 5"
"First Soldier:","book 5"
"Look, sir.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"O,'tis Marcius!","book 5"
"Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.","book 5"
"First Roman:","book 5"
"This will I carry to Rome.","book 5"
"Second Roman:","book 5"
"And I this.","book 5"
"Third Roman:","book 5"
"A murrain on't! I took this for silver.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"See here these movers that do prize their hours","book 5"
"At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,","book 5"
"Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would","book 5"
"Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,","book 5"
"Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!","book 5"
"And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!","book 5"
"There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,","book 5"
"Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take","book 5"
"Convenient numbers to make good the city;","book 5"
"Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste","book 5"
"To help Cominius.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;","book 5"
"Thy exercise hath been too violent for","book 5"
"A second course of fight.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Sir, praise me not;","book 5"
"My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:","book 5"
"The blood I drop is rather physical","book 5"
"Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus","book 5"
"I will appear, and fight.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"Now the fair goddess, Fortune,","book 5"
"Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms","book 5"
"Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,","book 5"
"Prosperity be thy page!","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Thy friend no less","book 5"
"Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"Thou worthiest Marcius!","book 5"
"Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;","book 5"
"Call thither all the officers o' the town,","book 5"
"Where they shall know our mind: away!","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Breathe you, my friends: well fought;","book 5"
"we are come off","book 5"
"Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,","book 5"
"Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,","book 5"
"We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,","book 5"
"By interims and conveying gusts we have heard","book 5"
"The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!","book 5"
"Lead their successes as we wish our own,","book 5"
"That both our powers, with smiling","book 5"
"fronts encountering,","book 5"
"May give you thankful sacrifice.","book 5"
"Thy news?","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"The citizens of Corioli have issued,","book 5"
"And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:","book 5"
"I saw our party to their trenches driven,","book 5"
"And then I came away.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Though thou speak'st truth,","book 5"
"Methinks thou speak'st not well.","book 5"
"How long is't since?","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"Above an hour, my lord.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:","book 5"
"How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,","book 5"
"And bring thy news so late?","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"Spies of the Volsces","book 5"
"Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel","book 5"
"Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,","book 5"
"Half an hour since brought my report.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Who's yonder,","book 5"
"That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods","book 5"
"He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have","book 5"
"Before-time seen him thus.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour","book 5"
"More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue","book 5"
"From every meaner man.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Come I too late?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,","book 5"
"But mantled in your own.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"O, let me clip ye","book 5"
"In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart","book 5"
"As merry as when our nuptial day was done,","book 5"
"And tapers burn'd to bedward!","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Flower of warriors,","book 5"
"How is it with Titus Lartius?","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"As with a man busied about decrees:","book 5"
"Condemning some to death, and some to exile;","book 5"
"Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;","book 5"
"Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,","book 5"
"Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,","book 5"
"To let him slip at will.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Where is that slave","book 5"
"Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?","book 5"
"Where is he? call him hither.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Let him alone;","book 5"
"He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,","book 5"
"The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--","book 5"
"The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge","book 5"
"From rascals worse than they.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"But how prevail'd you?","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.","book 5"
"Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?","book 5"
"If not, why cease you till you are so?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Marcius,","book 5"
"We have at disadvantage fought and did","book 5"
"Retire to win our purpose.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"How lies their battle? know you on which side","book 5"
"They have placed their men of trust?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"As I guess, Marcius,","book 5"
"Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,","book 5"
"Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,","book 5"
"Their very heart of hope.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"I do beseech you,","book 5"
"By all the battles wherein we have fought,","book 5"
"By the blood we have shed together, by the vows","book 5"
"We have made to endure friends, that you directly","book 5"
"Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;","book 5"
"And that you not delay the present, but,","book 5"
"Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,","book 5"
"We prove this very hour.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Though I could wish","book 5"
"You were conducted to a gentle bath","book 5"
"And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never","book 5"
"Deny your asking: take your choice of those","book 5"
"That best can aid your action.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Those are they","book 5"
"That most are willing. If any such be here--","book 5"
"As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting","book 5"
"Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear","book 5"
"Lesser his person than an ill report;","book 5"
"If any think brave death outweighs bad life","book 5"
"And that his country's dearer than himself;","book 5"
"Let him alone, or so many so minded,","book 5"
"Wave thus, to express his disposition,","book 5"
"And follow Marcius.","book 5"
"O, me alone! make you a sword of me?","book 5"
"If these shows be not outward, which of you","book 5"
"But is four Volsces? none of you but is","book 5"
"Able to bear against the great Aufidius","book 5"
"A shield as hard as his. A certain number,","book 5"
"Though thanks to all, must I select","book 5"
"from all: the rest","book 5"
"Shall bear the business in some other fight,","book 5"
"As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;","book 5"
"And four shall quickly draw out my command,","book 5"
"Which men are best inclined.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"March on, my fellows:","book 5"
"Make good this ostentation, and you shall","book 5"
"Divide in all with us.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,","book 5"
"As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch","book 5"
"Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve","book 5"
"For a short holding: if we lose the field,","book 5"
"We cannot keep the town.","book 5"
"Lieutenant:","book 5"
"Fear not our care, sir.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"Hence, and shut your gates upon's.","book 5"
"Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee","book 5"
"Worse than a promise-breaker.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"We hate alike:","book 5"
"Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor","book 5"
"More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Let the first budger die the other's slave,","book 5"
"And the gods doom him after!","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"If I fly, Marcius,","book 5"
"Holloa me like a hare.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Within these three hours, Tullus,","book 5"
"Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,","book 5"
"And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood","book 5"
"Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge","book 5"
"Wrench up thy power to the highest.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Wert thou the Hector","book 5"
"That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,","book 5"
"Thou shouldst not scape me here.","book 5"
"Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me","book 5"
"In your condemned seconds.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,","book 5"
"Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it","book 5"
"Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,","book 5"
"Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,","book 5"
"I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,","book 5"
"And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the","book 5"
"dull tribunes,","book 5"
"That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,","book 5"
"Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods","book 5"
"Our Rome hath such a soldier.'","book 5"
"Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,","book 5"
"Having fully dined before.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"O general,","book 5"
"Here is the steed, we the caparison:","book 5"
"Hadst thou beheld--","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"Pray now, no more: my mother,","book 5"
"Who has a charter to extol her blood,","book 5"
"When she does praise me grieves me. I have done","book 5"
"As you have done; that's what I can; induced","book 5"
"As you have been; that's for my country:","book 5"
"He that has but effected his good will","book 5"
"Hath overta'en mine act.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"You shall not be","book 5"
"The grave of your deserving; Rome must know","book 5"
"The value of her own: 'twere a concealment","book 5"
"Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,","book 5"
"To hide your doings; and to silence that,","book 5"
"Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,","book 5"
"Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you","book 5"
"In sign of what you are, not to reward","book 5"
"What you have done--before our army hear me.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"I have some wounds upon me, and they smart","book 5"
"To hear themselves remember'd.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Should they not,","book 5"
"Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,","book 5"
"And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,","book 5"
"Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all","book 5"
"The treasure in this field achieved and city,","book 5"
"We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,","book 5"
"Before the common distribution, at","book 5"
"Your only choice.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"I thank you, general;","book 5"
"But cannot make my heart consent to take","book 5"
"A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;","book 5"
"And stand upon my common part with those","book 5"
"That have beheld the doing.","book 5"
"MARCIUS:","book 5"
"May these same instruments, which you profane,","book 5"
"Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall","book 5"
"I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be","book 5"
"Made all of false-faced soothing!","book 5"
"When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,","book 5"
"Let him be made a coverture for the wars!","book 5"
"No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd","book 5"
"My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--","book 5"
"Which, without note, here's many else have done,--","book 5"
"You shout me forth","book 5"
"In acclamations hyperbolical;","book 5"
"As if I loved my little should be dieted","book 5"
"In praises sauced with lies.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Too modest are you;","book 5"
"More cruel to your good report than grateful","book 5"
"To us that give you truly: by your patience,","book 5"
"If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,","book 5"
"Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,","book 5"
"Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,","book 5"
"As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius","book 5"
"Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,","book 5"
"My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,","book 5"
"With all his trim belonging; and from this time,","book 5"
"For what he did before Corioli, call him,","book 5"
"With all the applause and clamour of the host,","book 5"
"CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear","book 5"
"The addition nobly ever!","book 5"
"All:","book 5"
"Caius Marcius Coriolanus!","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"I will go wash;","book 5"
"And when my face is fair, you shall perceive","book 5"
"Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.","book 5"
"I mean to stride your steed, and at all times","book 5"
"To undercrest your good addition","book 5"
"To the fairness of my power.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"So, to our tent;","book 5"
"Where, ere we do repose us, we will write","book 5"
"To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,","book 5"
"Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome","book 5"
"The best, with whom we may articulate,","book 5"
"For their own good and ours.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"I shall, my lord.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"The gods begin to mock me. I, that now","book 5"
"Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg","book 5"
"Of my lord general.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"I sometime lay here in Corioli","book 5"
"At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:","book 5"
"He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;","book 5"
"But then Aufidius was within my view,","book 5"
"And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you","book 5"
"To give my poor host freedom.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"O, well begg'd!","book 5"
"Were he the butcher of my son, he should","book 5"
"Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"Marcius, his name?","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"By Jupiter! forgot.","book 5"
"I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.","book 5"
"Have we no wine here?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Go we to our tent:","book 5"
"The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time","book 5"
"It should be look'd to: come.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"The town is ta'en!","book 5"
"First Soldier:","book 5"
"'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Condition!","book 5"
"I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,","book 5"
"Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!","book 5"
"What good condition can a treaty find","book 5"
"I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,","book 5"
"I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,","book 5"
"And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter","book 5"
"As often as we eat. By the elements,","book 5"
"If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,","book 5"
"He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation","book 5"
"Hath not that honour in't it had; for where","book 5"
"I thought to crush him in an equal force,","book 5"
"True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way","book 5"
"Or wrath or craft may get him.","book 5"
"First Soldier:","book 5"
"He's the devil.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd","book 5"
"With only suffering stain by him; for him","book 5"
"Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,","book 5"
"Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,","book 5"
"The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,","book 5"
"Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up","book 5"
"Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst","book 5"
"My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it","book 5"
"At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,","book 5"
"Against the hospitable canon, would I","book 5"
"Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;","book 5"
"Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must","book 5"
"Be hostages for Rome.","book 5"
"First Soldier:","book 5"
"Will not you go?","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--","book 5"
"'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither","book 5"
"How the world goes, that to the pace of it","book 5"
"I may spur on my journey.","book 5"
"First Soldier:","book 5"
"I shall, sir.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Good or bad?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Not according to the prayer of the people, for they","book 5"
"love not Marcius.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Pray you, who does the wolf love?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"The lamb.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the","book 5"
"noble Marcius.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two","book 5"
"are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.","book 5"
"Both:","book 5"
"Well, sir.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two","book 5"
"have not in abundance?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Especially in pride.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"And topping all others in boasting.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"This is strange now: do you two know how you are","book 5"
"censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the","book 5"
"right-hand file? do you?","book 5"
"Both:","book 5"
"Why, how are we censured?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?","book 5"
"Both:","book 5"
"Well, well, sir, well.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of","book 5"
"occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:","book 5"
"give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at","book 5"
"your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a","book 5"
"pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for","book 5"
"being proud?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"We do it not alone, sir.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I know you can do very little alone; for your helps","book 5"
"are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous","book 5"
"single: your abilities are too infant-like for","book 5"
"doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you","book 5"
"could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,","book 5"
"and make but an interior survey of your good selves!","book 5"
"O that you could!","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"What then, sir?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,","book 5"
"proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as","book 5"
"any in Rome.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Menenius, you are known well enough too.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that","book 5"
"loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying","book 5"
"Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in","book 5"
"favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like","book 5"
"upon too trivial motion; one that converses more","book 5"
"with the buttock of the night than with the forehead","book 5"
"of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my","book 5"
"malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as","book 5"
"you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink","book 5"
"you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a","book 5"
"crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have","book 5"
"delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in","book 5"
"compound with the major part of your syllables: and","book 5"
"though I must be content to bear with those that say","book 5"
"you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that","book 5"
"tell you you have good faces. If you see this in","book 5"
"the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known","book 5"
"well enough too? what barm can your bisson","book 5"
"conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be","book 5"
"known well enough too?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You","book 5"
"are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you","book 5"
"wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a","book 5"
"cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;","book 5"
"and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a","book 5"
"second day of audience. When you are hearing a","book 5"
"matter between party and party, if you chance to be","book 5"
"pinched with the colic, you make faces like","book 5"
"mummers; set up the bloody flag against all","book 5"
"patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,","book 5"
"dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled","book 5"
"by your hearing: all the peace you make in their","book 5"
"cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are","book 5"

"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall","book 5"
"encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When","book 5"
"you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the","book 5"
"wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not","book 5"
"so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's","book 5"
"cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-","book 5"
"saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;","book 5"
"who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors","book 5"
"since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the","book 5"
"best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to","book 5"
"your worships: more of your conversation would","book 5"
"infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly","book 5"
"plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.","book 5"

"Ha! Marcius coming home!","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous","book 5"
"approbation.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!","book 5"
"Marcius coming home!","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Nay,'tis true.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath","book 5"

"at home for you.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for","book 5"
"me!","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven","book 5"
"years' health; in which time I will make a lip at","book 5"
"the physician: the most sovereign prescription in","book 5"
"Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,","book 5"
"of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he","book 5"
"not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.","book 5"
"VIRGILIA:","book 5"
"O, no, no, no.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'","book 5"

"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home","book 5"
"with the oaken garland.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but","book 5"
"Aufidius got off.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:","book 5"
"an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so","book 5"
"fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold","book 5"
"that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate","book 5"
"has letters from the general, wherein he gives my","book 5"

"action outdone his former deeds doubly","book 5"
"VALERIA:","book 5"
"In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.","book 5"

"The gods grant them true!","book 5"

"True! I'll be sworn they are true.","book 5"
"Where is he wounded?","book 5"
"God save your good worships! Marcius is coming","book 5"

"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be","book 5"
"large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall","book 5"
"stand for his place. He received in the repulse of","book 5"
"Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's","book 5"
"nine that I know.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five","book 5"
"wounds upon him.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.","book 5"
"Hark! the trumpets.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he","book 5"
"carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:","book 5"
"Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;","book 5"
"Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.","book 5"
"Herald:","book 5"

"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"O,","book 5"
"You have, I know, petition'd all the gods","book 5"
"For my prosperity!","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Nay, my good soldier, up;","book 5"
"My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and","book 5"
"By deed-achieving honour newly named,--","book 5"
"What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--","book 5"
"But O, thy wife!","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"My gracious silence, hail!","book 5"
"Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,","book 5"
"That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,","book 5"

"O my sweet lady, pardon.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:","book 5"
"And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.","book 5"

"A curse begin at very root on's heart,","book 5"
"That is not glad to see thee! You are three","book 5"
"That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,","book 5"
"We have some old crab-trees here","book 5"
"at home that will not","book 5"
"Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:","book 5"
"We call a nettle but a nettle and","book 5"
"The faults of fools but folly.","book 5"

"Our Rome will cast upon thee.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Know, good mother,","book 5"
"I had rather be their servant in my way,","book 5"
"Than sway with them in theirs.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"On, to the Capitol!","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights","book 5"
"Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse","book 5"
"Into a rapture lets her baby cry","book 5"
"While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins","book 5"
"Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,","book 5"
"Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,","book 5"
"Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed","book 5"
"With variable complexions, all agreeing","book 5"
"In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens","book 5"
"Do press among the popular throngs and puff","book 5"
"To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames","book 5"
"Commit the war of white and damask in","book 5"
"Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil","book 5"
"Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother","book 5"
"As if that whatsoever god who leads him","book 5"
"Were slily crept into his human powers","book 5"
"And gave him graceful posture.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"On the sudden,","book 5"
"I warrant him consul.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Then our office may,","book 5"
"During his power, go sleep.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"He cannot temperately transport his honours","book 5"
"From where he should begin and end, but will","book 5"
"Lose those he hath won.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"In that there's comfort.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Doubt not","book 5"
"The commoners, for whom we stand, but they","book 5"
"Upon their ancient malice will forget","book 5"
"With the least cause these his new honours, which","book 5"
"That he will give them make I as little question","book 5"
"As he is proud to do't.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"I heard him swear,","book 5"
"Were he to stand for consul, never would he","book 5"
"Appear i' the market-place nor on him put","book 5"
"The napless vesture of humility;","book 5"
"Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds","book 5"
"To the people, beg their stinking breaths.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"'Tis right.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"It was his word: O, he would miss it rather","book 5"
"Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,","book 5"
"And the desire of the nobles.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"I wish no better","book 5"
"Than have him hold that purpose and to put it","book 5"
"In execution.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"'Tis most like he will.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"It shall be to him then as our good wills,","book 5"
"A sure destruction.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"So it must fall out","book 5"
"To him or our authorities. For an end,","book 5"
"We must suggest the people in what hatred","book 5"
"He still hath held them; that to's power he would","book 5"
"Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and","book 5"
"Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,","book 5"
"In human action and capacity,","book 5"
"Of no more soul nor fitness for the world","book 5"
"Than camels in the war, who have their provand","book 5"
"Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows","book 5"
"For sinking under them.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"This, as you say, suggested","book 5"
"At some time when his soaring insolence","book 5"
"Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,","book 5"
"If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy","book 5"
"As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire","book 5"
"To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze","book 5"
"Shall darken him for ever.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"What's the matter?","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought","book 5"
"That Marcius shall be consul:","book 5"
"I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and","book 5"
"The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,","book 5"
"Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,","book 5"
"Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,","book 5"
"As to Jove's statue, and the commons made","book 5"
"A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:","book 5"
"I never saw the like.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Let's to the Capitol;","book 5"
"And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,","book 5"
"But hearts for the event.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Have with you.","book 5"
"First Officer:","book 5"
"Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand","book 5"
"for consulships?","book 5"
"Second Officer:","book 5"
"Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one","book 5"
"Coriolanus will carry it.","book 5"
"First Officer:","book 5"
"That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and","book 5"
"loves not the common people.","book 5"
"Second Officer:","book 5"
"Faith, there had been many great men that have","book 5"
"flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there","book 5"
"be many that they have loved, they know not","book 5"
"wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,","book 5"
"they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for","book 5"
"Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate","book 5"
"him manifests the true knowledge he has in their","book 5"
"disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets","book 5"
"them plainly see't.","book 5"
"First Officer:","book 5"
"If he did not care whether he had their love or no,","book 5"
"he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither","book 5"
"good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater","book 5"
"devotion than can render it him; and leaves","book 5"
"nothing undone that may fully discover him their","book 5"
"opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and","book 5"
"displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he","book 5"
"dislikes, to flatter them for their love.","book 5"
"Second Officer:","book 5"
"He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his","book 5"
"ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,","book 5"
"having been supple and courteous to the people,","book 5"
"bonneted, without any further deed to have them at","book 5"
"an into their estimation and report: but he hath so","book 5"
"planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions","book 5"
"in their hearts, that for their tongues to be","book 5"
"silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of","book 5"
"ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a","book 5"
"malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck","book 5"
"reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.","book 5"
"First Officer:","book 5"
"No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they","book 5"
"are coming.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Having determined of the Volsces and","book 5"
"To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,","book 5"
"As the main point of this our after-meeting,","book 5"
"To gratify his noble service that","book 5"
"Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,","book 5"
"please you,","book 5"
"Most reverend and grave elders, to desire","book 5"
"The present consul, and last general","book 5"
"In our well-found successes, to report","book 5"
"A little of that worthy work perform'd","book 5"
"By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom","book 5"
"We met here both to thank and to remember","book 5"
"With honours like himself.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Speak, good Cominius:","book 5"
"Leave nothing out for length, and make us think","book 5"
"Rather our state's defective for requital","book 5"
"Than we to stretch it out.","book 5"
"Masters o' the people,","book 5"
"We do request your kindest ears, and after,","book 5"
"Your loving motion toward the common body,","book 5"
"To yield what passes here.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"We are convented","book 5"
"Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts","book 5"
"Inclinable to honour and advance","book 5"
"The theme of our assembly.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Which the rather","book 5"
"We shall be blest to do, if he remember","book 5"
"A kinder value of the people than","book 5"
"He hath hereto prized them at.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"That's off, that's off;","book 5"
"I would you rather had been silent. Please you","book 5"
"To hear Cominius speak?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Most willingly;","book 5"
"But yet my caution was more pertinent","book 5"
"Than the rebuke you give it.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"He loves your people","book 5"
"But tie him not to be their bedfellow.","book 5"
"Worthy Cominius, speak.","book 5"
"Nay, keep your place.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear","book 5"
"What you have nobly done.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Your horror's pardon:","book 5"
"I had rather have my wounds to heal again","book 5"
"Than hear say how I got them.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Sir, I hope","book 5"
"My words disbench'd you not.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"No, sir: yet oft,","book 5"
"When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.","book 5"
"You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but","book 5"
"your people,","book 5"
"I love them as they weigh.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Pray now, sit down.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun","book 5"
"When the alarum were struck than idly sit","book 5"
"To hear my nothings monster'd.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Masters of the people,","book 5"
"Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--","book 5"
"That's thousand to one good one--when you now see","book 5"
"He had rather venture all his limbs for honour","book 5"
"Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus","book 5"
"Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held","book 5"
"That valour is the chiefest virtue, and","book 5"
"Most dignifies the haver: if it be,","book 5"
"The man I speak of cannot in the world","book 5"
"Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,","book 5"
"When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought","book 5"
"Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,","book 5"
"Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,","book 5"
"When with his Amazonian chin he drove","book 5"
"The bristled lips before him: be bestrid","book 5"
"An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view","book 5"
"Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,","book 5"
"And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,","book 5"
"When he might act the woman in the scene,","book 5"
"He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed","book 5"
"Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age","book 5"
"Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,","book 5"
"And in the brunt of seventeen battles since","book 5"
"He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,","book 5"
"Before and in Corioli, let me say,","book 5"
"I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;","book 5"
"And by his rare example made the coward","book 5"
"Turn terror into sport: as weeds before","book 5"
"A vessel under sail, so men obey'd","book 5"
"And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,","book 5"
"Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot","book 5"
"He was a thing of blood, whose every motion","book 5"
"Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd","book 5"
"The mortal gate of the city, which he painted","book 5"
"With shunless destiny; aidless came off,","book 5"
"And with a sudden reinforcement struck","book 5"
"Corioli like a planet: now all's his:","book 5"
"When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce","book 5"
"His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit","book 5"
"Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,","book 5"
"And to the battle came he; where he did","book 5"
"Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if","book 5"
"'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd","book 5"
"Both field and city ours, he never stood","book 5"
"To ease his breast with panting.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Worthy man!","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"He cannot but with measure fit the honours","book 5"
"Which we devise him.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Our spoils he kick'd at,","book 5"
"And look'd upon things precious as they were","book 5"
"The common muck of the world: he covets less","book 5"
"Than misery itself would give; rewards","book 5"
"His deeds with doing them, and is content","book 5"
"To spend the time to end it.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"He's right noble:","book 5"
"Let him be call'd for.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Call Coriolanus.","book 5"
"Officer:","book 5"
"He doth appear.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased","book 5"
"To make thee consul.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"I do owe them still","book 5"
"My life and services.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"It then remains","book 5"
"That you do speak to the people.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"I do beseech you,","book 5"
"Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot","book 5"
"Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,","book 5"
"For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you","book 5"
"That I may pass this doing.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Sir, the people","book 5"
"Must have their voices; neither will they bate","book 5"
"One jot of ceremony.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Put them not to't:","book 5"
"Pray you, go fit you to the custom and","book 5"
"Take to you, as your predecessors have,","book 5"
"Your honour with your form.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"It is apart","book 5"
"That I shall blush in acting, and might well","book 5"
"Be taken from the people.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Mark you that?","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;","book 5"
"Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,","book 5"
"As if I had received them for the hire","book 5"
"Of their breath only!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Do not stand upon't.","book 5"
"We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,","book 5"
"Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul","book 5"
"Wish we all joy and honour.","book 5"
"Senators:","book 5"
"To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"You see how he intends to use the people.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"May they perceive's intent! He will require them,","book 5"
"As if he did contemn what he requested","book 5"
"Should be in them to give.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Come, we'll inform them","book 5"
"Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,","book 5"
"I know, they do attend us.","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"We may, sir, if we will.","book 5"

"We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a","book 5"
"power that we have no power to do; for if he show us","book 5"
"his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our","book 5"
"tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if","book 5"
"he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him","book 5"
"our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is","book 5"
"monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,","book 5"
"were to make a monster of the multitude: of the","book 5"
"which we being members, should bring ourselves to be","book 5"
"monstrous members.","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"And to make us no better thought of, a little help","book 5"
"will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he","book 5"
"himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"We have been called so of many; not that our heads","book 5"
"are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,","book 5"
"but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and","book 5"
"truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of","book 5"
"one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,","book 5"
"and their consent of one direct way should be at","book 5"
"once to all the points o' the compass.","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would","book 5"
"fly?","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's","book 5"
"will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but","book 5"
"if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"Why that way?","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts","book 5"
"melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return","book 5"
"for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"Are you all resolved to give your voices? But","book 5"
"that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I","book 5"
"say, if he would incline to the people, there was","book 5"
"never a worthier man.","book 5"
"Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his","book 5"
"behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to","book 5"
"come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and","book 5"
"by threes. He's to make his requests by","book 5"
"particulars; wherein every one of us has a single","book 5"
"honour, in giving him our own voices with our own","book 5"
"tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how","book 5"
"you shall go by him.","book 5"
"All:","book 5"
"Content, content.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"O sir, you are not right: have you not known","book 5"
"The worthiest men have done't?","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"What must I say?","book 5"
"'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring","book 5"
"My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!","book 5"
"I got them in my country's service, when","book 5"
"Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran","book 5"
"From the noise of our own drums.'","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"O me, the gods!","book 5"
"You must not speak of that: you must desire them","book 5"
"To think upon you.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Think upon me! hang 'em!","book 5"
"I would they would forget me, like the virtues","book 5"
"Which our divines lose by 'em.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"You'll mar all:","book 5"
"I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,","book 5"
"In wholesome manner.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Bid them wash their faces","book 5"
"And keep their teeth clean.","book 5"
"So, here comes a brace.","book 5"
"You know the cause, air, of my standing here.","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Mine own desert.","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"Your own desert!","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Ay, but not mine own desire.","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"How not your own desire?","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the","book 5"
"poor with begging.","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to","book 5"
"gain by you.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"The price is to ask it kindly.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to","book 5"
"show you, which shall be yours in private. Your","book 5"
"good voice, sir; what say you?","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"You shall ha' it, worthy sir.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices","book 5"
"begged. I have your alms: adieu.","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"But this is something odd.","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your","book 5"

"customary gown.","book 5"
"Fourth Citizen:","book 5"
"You have deserved nobly of your country, and you","book 5"
"have not deserved nobly.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Your enigma?","book 5"
"Fourth Citizen:","book 5"
"You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have","book 5"
"been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved","book 5"
"the common people.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"You should account me the more virtuous that I have","book 5"
"not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my","book 5"
"sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer","book 5"
"estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account","book 5"
"gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is","book 5"
"rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise","book 5"
"the insinuating nod and be off to them most","book 5"
"counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the","book 5"
"bewitchment of some popular man and give it","book 5"
"bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,","book 5"
"I may be consul.","book 5"
"Fifth Citizen:","book 5"
"We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give","book 5"
"you our voices heartily.","book 5"
"Fourth Citizen:","book 5"
"You have received many wounds for your country.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I","book 5"
"will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.","book 5"
"Both Citizens:","book 5"
"The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Most sweet voices!","book 5"
"Better it is to die, better to starve,","book 5"
"Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.","book 5"
"Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,","book 5"
"To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,","book 5"
"Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:","book 5"
"What custom wills, in all things should we do't,","book 5"
"The dust on antique time would lie unswept,","book 5"
"And mountainous error be too highly heapt","book 5"
"For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,","book 5"
"Let the high office and the honour go","book 5"
"To one that would do thus. I am half through;","book 5"
"The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.","book 5"
"Here come more voices.","book 5"
"Your voices: for your voices I have fought;","book 5"
"Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear","book 5"
"Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six","book 5"
"I have seen and heard of; for your voices have","book 5"
"Done many things, some less, some more your voices:","book 5"
"Indeed I would be consul.","book 5"
"Sixth Citizen:","book 5"
"He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest","book 5"
"man's voice.","book 5"
"Seventh Citizen:","book 5"
"Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,","book 5"

"All Citizens:","book 5"
"Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Worthy voices!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes","book 5"
"Endue you with the people's voice: remains","book 5"
"That, in the official marks invested, you","book 5"
"Anon do meet the senate.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Is this done?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"The custom of request you have discharged:","book 5"
"The people do admit you, and are summon'd","book 5"
"To meet anon, upon your approbation.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Where? at the senate-house?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"There, Coriolanus.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"May I change these garments?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"You may, sir.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,","book 5"
"Repair to the senate-house.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I'll keep you company. Will you along?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"We stay here for the people.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Fare you well.","book 5"
"He has it now, and by his looks methink","book 5"
"'Tis warm at 's heart.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.","book 5"
"will you dismiss the people?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"How now, my masters! have you chose this man?","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"He has our voices, sir.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,","book 5"
"He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"Certainly","book 5"
"He flouted us downright.","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says","book 5"
"He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us","book 5"
"His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Why, so he did, I am sure.","book 5"
"Citizens:","book 5"
"No, no; no man saw 'em.","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"He said he had wounds, which he could show","book 5"
"in private;","book 5"
"And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,","book 5"
"'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,","book 5"
"But by your voices, will not so permit me;","book 5"
"Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,","book 5"
"Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:","book 5"
"Your most sweet voices: now you have left","book 5"
"your voices,","book 5"
"I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Why either were you ignorant to see't,","book 5"
"Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness","book 5"
"To yield your voices?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Could you not have told him","book 5"
"As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,","book 5"
"But was a petty servant to the state,","book 5"
"He was your enemy, ever spake against","book 5"
"Your liberties and the charters that you bear","book 5"
"I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving","book 5"
"A place of potency and sway o' the state,","book 5"
"If he should still malignantly remain","book 5"
"Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might","book 5"
"Be curses to yourselves? You should have said","book 5"
"That as his worthy deeds did claim no less","book 5"
"Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature","book 5"
"Would think upon you for your voices and","book 5"
"Translate his malice towards you into love,","book 5"
"Standing your friendly lord.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Thus to have said,","book 5"
"As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit","book 5"
"And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd","book 5"
"Either his gracious promise, which you might,","book 5"
"As cause had call'd you up, have held him to","book 5"
"Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,","book 5"
"Which easily endures not article","book 5"
"Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,","book 5"
"You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler","book 5"
"And pass'd him unelected.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Did you perceive","book 5"
"He did solicit you in free contempt","book 5"
"When he did need your loves, and do you think","book 5"
"That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,","book 5"
"When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies","book 5"
"No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry","book 5"
"Against the rectorship of judgment?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Have you","book 5"
"Ere now denied the asker? and now again","book 5"
"Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow","book 5"
"Your sued-for tongues?","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"And will deny him:","book 5"
"I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,","book 5"
"They have chose a consul that will from them take","book 5"
"Their liberties; make them of no more voice","book 5"
"Than dogs that are as often beat for barking","book 5"
"As therefore kept to do so.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Let them assemble,","book 5"
"And on a safer judgment all revoke","book 5"
"Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,","book 5"
"And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not","book 5"
"With what contempt he wore the humble weed,","book 5"
"How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,","book 5"
"Thinking upon his services, took from you","book 5"
"The apprehension of his present portance,","book 5"
"Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion","book 5"
"After the inveterate hate he bears you.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Lay","book 5"
"A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,","book 5"
"No impediment between, but that you must","book 5"
"Cast your election on him.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Say, you chose him","book 5"
"More after our commandment than as guided","book 5"
"By your own true affections, and that your minds,","book 5"
"Preoccupied with what you rather must do","book 5"
"Than what you should, made you against the grain","book 5"
"To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.","book 5"
"How youngly he began to serve his country,","book 5"
"How long continued, and what stock he springs of,","book 5"
"The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came","book 5"
"That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,","book 5"
"Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;","book 5"
"Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,","book 5"
"That our beat water brought by conduits hither;","book 5"
"And  ","book 5"
"Twice being  ","book 5"
"Was his great ancestor.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"One thus descended,","book 5"
"That hath beside well in his person wrought","book 5"
"To be set high in place, we did commend","book 5"
"To your remembrances: but you have found,","book 5"
"Scaling his present bearing with his past,","book 5"
"That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke","book 5"
"Your sudden approbation.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Say, you ne'er had done't--","book 5"
"Harp on that still--but by our putting on;","book 5"
"And presently, when you have drawn your number,","book 5"
"Repair to the Capitol.","book 5"
"All:","book 5"
"We will so: almost all","book 5"
"Repent in their election.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Let them go on;","book 5"
"This mutiny were better put in hazard,","book 5"
"Than stay, past doubt, for greater:","book 5"
"If, as his nature is, he fall in rage","book 5"
"With their refusal, both observe and answer","book 5"
"The vantage of his anger.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"To the Capitol, come:","book 5"
"We will be there before the stream o' the people;","book 5"
"And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,","book 5"
"Which we have goaded onward.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"He had, my lord; and that it was which caused","book 5"
"Our swifter composition.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"So then the Volsces stand but as at first,","book 5"
"Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.","book 5"
"Upon's again.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"They are worn, lord consul, so,","book 5"
"That we shall hardly in our ages see","book 5"
"Their banners wave again.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Saw you Aufidius?","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse","book 5"
"Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely","book 5"
"Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Spoke he of me?","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"He did, my lord.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"How? what?","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"How often he had met you, sword to sword;","book 5"
"That of all things upon the earth he hated","book 5"
"Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes","book 5"
"To hopeless restitution, so he might","book 5"
"Be call'd your vanquisher.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"At Antium lives he?","book 5"
"LARTIUS:","book 5"
"At Antium.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"I wish I had a cause to seek him there,","book 5"
"To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.","book 5"
"Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,","book 5"
"The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;","book 5"
"For they do prank them in authority,","book 5"
"Against all noble sufferance.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Pass no further.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Ha! what is that?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"It will be dangerous to go on: no further.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"What makes this change?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"The matter?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Cominius, no.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Have I had children's voices?","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"

"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"The people are incensed against him.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Stop,","book 5"
"Or all will fall in broil.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Are these your herd?","book 5"
"Must these have voices, that can yield them now","book 5"
"And straight disclaim their tongues? What are","book 5"
"your offices?","book 5"
"You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?","book 5"
"Have you not set them on?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Be calm, be calm.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,","book 5"

"Nor ever will be ruled.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Call't not a plot:","book 5"

"When corn was given them gratis, you repined;","book 5"
"Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them","book 5"
"Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Why, this was known before.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Not to them all.","book 5"

"Your fellow tribune.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"You show too much of that","book 5"
"For which the people stir: if you will pass","book 5"
"To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,","book 5"
"Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,","book 5"

"Choler!","book 5"
"Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,","book 5"
"By Jove, 'twould be my mind!","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"It is a mind","book 5"
"That shall remain a poison where it is,","book 5"
"Not poison any further.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Shall remain!","book 5"
"Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you","book 5"

"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"'Twas from the canon.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"'Shall'!","book 5"
"O good but most unwise patricians! why,","book 5"
"You grave but reckless senators, have you thus","book 5"
"Given Hydra here to choose an officer,","book 5"
"That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but","book 5"
"The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit","book 5"
"To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,","book 5"
"And make your channel his? If he have power","book 5"
"Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake","book 5"
"Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,","book 5"
"Be not as common fools; if you are not,","book 5"
"Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,","book 5"
"If they be senators: and they are no less,","book 5"
"When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste","book 5"
"Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,","book 5"
"And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'","book 5"
"His popular 'shall' against a graver bench","book 5"
"Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!","book 5"
"It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches","book 5"

"Though there the people had more absolute power,","book 5"

"One that speaks thus their voice?","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"I'll give my reasons,","book 5"
"More worthier than their voices. They know the corn","book 5"
"Was not our recompense, resting well assured","book 5"
"That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,","book 5"
"Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,","book 5"
"They would not thread the gates. This kind of service","book 5"
"Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war","book 5"
"Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd","book 5"
"Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation","book 5"
"Which they have often made against the senate,","book 5"

"To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,","book 5"

"Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--","book 5"
"You that will be less fearful than discreet,","book 5"
"That love the fundamental part of state","book 5"
"More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer","book 5"
"A noble life before a long, and wish","book 5"

"That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out","book 5"
"The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick","book 5"
"The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour","book 5"

"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"And so are like to do.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"That is the way to lay the city flat;","book 5"
"To bring the roof to the foundation,","book 5"
"And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,","book 5"
"In heaps and piles of ruin.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"This deserves death.","book 5"

"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Sir, those cold ways,","book 5"

"Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;","book 5"
"One time will owe another.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"On fair ground","book 5"
"I could beat forty of them.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"I could myself","book 5"
"Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the","book 5"

"But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;","book 5"
"And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands","book 5"
"Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,","book 5"
"Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend","book 5"
"Like interrupted waters and o'erbear","book 5"
"What they are used to bear.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"

"I'll try whether my old wit be in request","book 5"
"With those that have but little: this must be patch'd","book 5"
"With cloth of any colour.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Nay, come away.","book 5"
"A Patrician:","book 5"
"This man has marr'd his fortune.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"His nature is too noble for the world:","book 5"
"He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,","book 5"
"Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:","book 5"
"What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;","book 5"
"And, being angry, does forget that ever","book 5"
"He heard the name of death.","book 5"
"Here's goodly work!","book 5"
"Second Patrician:","book 5"
"I would they were abed!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!","book 5"
"Could he not speak 'em fair?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Where is this viper","book 5"
"That would depopulate the city and","book 5"
"Be every man himself?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"You worthy tribunes,--","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock","book 5"
"With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,","book 5"
"And therefore law shall scorn him further trial","book 5"
"Than the severity of the public power","book 5"
"Which he so sets at nought.","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"He shall well know","book 5"
"The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,","book 5"
"And we their hands.","book 5"
"Citizens:","book 5"
"He shall, sure on't.","book 5"

"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt","book 5"
"With modest warrant.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Sir, how comes't that you","book 5"
"Have holp to make this rescue?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Hear me speak:","book 5"
"As I do know the consul's worthiness,","book 5"
"So can I name his faults,--","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Consul! what consul?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"The consul Coriolanus.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"He consul!","book 5"
"Citizens:","book 5"
"No, no, no, no, no.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,","book 5"
"I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;","book 5"
"The which shall turn you to no further harm","book 5"
"Than so much loss of time.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Speak briefly then;","book 5"
"For we are peremptory to dispatch","book 5"
"This viperous traitor: to eject him hence","book 5"
"Were but one danger, and to keep him here","book 5"
"Our certain death: therefore it is decreed","book 5"
"He dies to-night.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Now the good gods forbid","book 5"
"That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude","book 5"
"Towards her deserved children is enroll'd","book 5"
"In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam","book 5"
"Should now eat up her own!","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"He's a disease that must be cut away.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"O, he's a limb that has but a disease;","book 5"
"Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.","book 5"
"What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?","book 5"
"Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--","book 5"
"Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,","book 5"
"By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;","book 5"
"And what is left, to lose it by his country,","book 5"
"Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,","book 5"
"A brand to the end o' the world.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"This is clean kam.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Merely awry: when he did love his country,","book 5"
"It honour'd him.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"The service of the foot","book 5"
"Being once gangrened, is not then respected","book 5"
"For what before it was.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"We'll hear no more.","book 5"
"Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:","book 5"
"Lest his infection, being of catching nature,","book 5"
"Spread further.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"One word more, one word.","book 5"
"This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find","book 5"
"The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late","book 5"
"Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;","book 5"
"Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,","book 5"
"And sack great Rome with Romans.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"If it were so,--","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"What do ye talk?","book 5"
"Have we not had a taste of his obedience?","book 5"
"Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars","book 5"
"Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd","book 5"
"In bolted language; meal and bran together","book 5"
"He throws without distinction. Give me leave,","book 5"
"I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him","book 5"
"Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,","book 5"
"In peace, to his utmost peril.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Noble tribunes,","book 5"
"It is the humane way: the other course","book 5"
"Will prove too bloody, and the end of it","book 5"
"Unknown to the beginning.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Noble Menenius,","book 5"
"Be you then as the people's officer.","book 5"
"Masters, lay down your weapons.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Go not home.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:","book 5"
"Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed","book 5"
"In our first way.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I'll bring him to you.","book 5"
"Let me desire your company: he must come,","book 5"
"Or what is worst will follow.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Pray you, let's to him.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Let them puff all about mine ears, present me","book 5"
"Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,","book 5"
"Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,","book 5"
"That the precipitation might down stretch","book 5"
"Below the beam of sight, yet will I still","book 5"
"Be thus to them.","book 5"
"A Patrician:","book 5"
"You do the nobler.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"I muse my mother","book 5"
"Does not approve me further, who was wont","book 5"
"To call them woollen vassals, things created","book 5"
"To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads","book 5"
"In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,","book 5"
"When one but of my ordinance stood up","book 5"
"To speak of peace or war.","book 5"
"I talk of you:","book 5"
"Why did you wish me milder? would you have me","book 5"
"False to my nature? Rather say I play","book 5"
"The man I am.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"O, sir, sir, sir,","book 5"
"I would have had you put your power well on,","book 5"
"Before you had worn it out.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Let go.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"You might have been enough the man you are,","book 5"
"With striving less to be so; lesser had been","book 5"
"The thwartings of your dispositions, if","book 5"
"You had not show'd them how ye were disposed","book 5"
"Ere they lack'd power to cross you.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Let them hang.","book 5"
"A Patrician:","book 5"
"Ay, and burn too.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Come, come, you have been too rough, something","book 5"
"too rough;","book 5"
"You must return and mend it.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"There's no remedy;","book 5"
"Unless, by not so doing, our good city","book 5"
"Cleave in the midst, and perish.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Pray, be counsell'd:","book 5"
"I have a heart as little apt as yours,","book 5"
"But yet a brain that leads my use of anger","book 5"
"To better vantage.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Well said, noble woman?","book 5"
"Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that","book 5"
"The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic","book 5"
"For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,","book 5"
"Which I can scarcely bear.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"What must I do?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Return to the tribunes.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Well, what then? what then?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Repent what you have spoke.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"For them! I cannot do it to the gods;","book 5"
"Must I then do't to them?","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"You are too absolute;","book 5"
"Though therein you can never be too noble,","book 5"
"But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,","book 5"
"Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,","book 5"
"I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,","book 5"
"In peace what each of them by the other lose,","book 5"
"That they combine not there.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Tush, tush!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"A good demand.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"If it be honour in your wars to seem","book 5"
"The same you are not, which, for your best ends,","book 5"
"You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,","book 5"
"That it shall hold companionship in peace","book 5"
"With honour, as in war, since that to both","book 5"
"It stands in like request?","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Why force you this?","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Because that now it lies you on to speak","book 5"
"To the people; not by your own instruction,","book 5"
"Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,","book 5"
"But with such words that are but rooted in","book 5"
"Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables","book 5"
"Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.","book 5"
"Now, this no more dishonours you at all","book 5"
"Than to take in a town with gentle words,","book 5"
"Which else would put you to your fortune and","book 5"
"The hazard of much blood.","book 5"
"I would dissemble with my nature where","book 5"
"My fortunes and my friends at stake required","book 5"
"I should do so in honour: I am in this,","book 5"
"Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;","book 5"

"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Noble lady!","book 5"

"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"I prithee now, my son,","book 5"
"Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;","book 5"
"And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--","book 5"
"Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business","book 5"
"Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant","book 5"
"More learned than the ears--waving thy head,","book 5"
"Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,","book 5"
"Now humble as the ripest mulberry","book 5"
"That will not hold the handling: or say to them,","book 5"
"Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils","book 5"
"Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,","book 5"
"Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,","book 5"
"In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame","book 5"
"Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far","book 5"
"As thou hast power and person.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"This but done,","book 5"
"Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;","book 5"
"For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free","book 5"
"As words to little purpose.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Prithee now,","book 5"
"Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather","book 5"
"Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf","book 5"
"Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit","book 5"
"You make strong party, or defend yourself","book 5"
"By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Only fair speech.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"I think 'twill serve, if he","book 5"

"He must, and will","book 5"
"Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?","book 5"
"Must I with base tongue give my noble heart","book 5"
"A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:","book 5"
"Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,","book 5"
"This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it","book 5"
"And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!","book 5"
"You have put me now to such a part which never","book 5"

"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Come, come, we'll prompt you.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said","book 5"
"My praises made thee first a soldier, so,","book 5"
"To have my praise for this, perform a part","book 5"
"Thou hast not done before.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Well, I must do't:","book 5"
"Away, my disposition, and possess me","book 5"
"Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,","book 5"
"Which quired with my drum, into a pipe","book 5"

"The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue","book 5"
"Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,","book 5"
"Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his","book 5"
"That hath received an alms! I will not do't,","book 5"
"Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth","book 5"
"And by my body's action teach my mind","book 5"
"A most inherent baseness.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"At thy choice, then:","book 5"
"To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour","book 5"
"Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let","book 5"
"Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear","book 5"
"Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death","book 5"
"With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list","book 5"
"Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,","book 5"

"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Pray, be content:","book 5"
"Mother, I am going to the market-place;","book 5"
"Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,","book 5"
"Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved","book 5"
"Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:","book 5"
"Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;","book 5"
"Or never trust to what my tongue can do","book 5"
"I' the way of flattery further.","book 5"
"VOLUMNIA:","book 5"
"Do your will.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself","book 5"
"To answer mildly; for they are prepared","book 5"
"With accusations, as I hear, more strong","book 5"
"Than are upon you yet.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:","book 5"
"Let them accuse me by invention, I","book 5"
"Will answer in mine honour.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Ay, but mildly.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"In this point charge him home, that he affects","book 5"
"Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,","book 5"
"Enforce him with his envy to the people,","book 5"
"And that the spoil got on the Antiates","book 5"
"Was ne'er distributed.","book 5"
"What, will he come?","book 5"
"AEdile:","book 5"
"He's coming.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"How accompanied?","book 5"
"AEdile:","book 5"
"With old Menenius, and those senators","book 5"
"That always favour'd him.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Have you a catalogue","book 5"
"Of all the voices that we have procured","book 5"
"Set down by the poll?","book 5"
"AEdile:","book 5"
"I have; 'tis ready.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Have you collected them by tribes?","book 5"
"AEdile:","book 5"
"I have.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Assemble presently the people hither;","book 5"
"And when they bear me say 'It shall be so","book 5"
"I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either","book 5"
"For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them","book 5"
"If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'","book 5"
"Insisting on the old prerogative","book 5"
"And power i' the truth o' the cause.","book 5"
"AEdile:","book 5"
"I shall inform them.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"And when such time they have begun to cry,","book 5"
"Let them not cease, but with a din confused","book 5"
"Enforce the present execution","book 5"
"Of what we chance to sentence.","book 5"
"AEdile:","book 5"
"Very well.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Make them be strong and ready for this hint,","book 5"
"When we shall hap to give 't them.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Go about it.","book 5"
"Put him to choler straight: he hath been used","book 5"
"Ever to conquer, and to have his worth","book 5"
"Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot","book 5"
"Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks","book 5"
"What's in his heart; and that is there which looks","book 5"
"With us to break his neck.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Well, here he comes.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Calmly, I do beseech you.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece","book 5"

"First Senator:","book 5"

"A noble wish.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Draw near, ye people.","book 5"
"AEdile:","book 5"
"List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"First, hear me speak.","book 5"
"Both Tribunes:","book 5"
"Well, say. Peace, ho!","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Shall I be charged no further than this present?","book 5"
"Must all determine here?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"I do demand,","book 5"
"If you submit you to the people's voices,","book 5"
"Allow their officers and are content","book 5"
"To suffer lawful censure for such faults","book 5"
"As shall be proved upon you?","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"I am content.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Lo, citizens, he says he is content:","book 5"
"The warlike service he has done, consider; think","book 5"
"Upon the wounds his body bears, which show","book 5"
"Like graves i' the holy churchyard.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Scratches with briers,","book 5"
"Scars to move laughter only.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Consider further,","book 5"
"That when he speaks not like a citizen,","book 5"
"You find him like a soldier: do not take","book 5"
"His rougher accents for malicious sounds,","book 5"
"But, as I say, such as become a soldier,","book 5"
"Rather than envy you.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Well, well, no more.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"What is the matter","book 5"
"That being pass'd for consul with full voice,","book 5"
"I am so dishonour'd that the very hour","book 5"
"You take it off again?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Answer to us.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"We charge you, that you have contrived to take","book 5"
"From Rome all season'd office and to wind","book 5"
"Yourself into a power tyrannical;","book 5"
"For which you are a traitor to the people.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"How! traitor!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Nay, temperately; your promise.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!","book 5"

"Citizens:","book 5"
"To the rock, to the rock with him!","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Peace!","book 5"
"We need not put new matter to his charge:","book 5"
"What you have seen him do and heard him speak,","book 5"
"Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,","book 5"
"Opposing laws with strokes and here defying","book 5"
"Those whose great power must try him; even this,","book 5"
"So criminal and in such capital kind,","book 5"
"Deserves the extremest death.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"But since he hath","book 5"
"Served well for Rome,--","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"What do you prate of service?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"I talk of that, that know it.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"You?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Is this the promise that you made your mother?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Know, I pray you,--","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"I know no further:","book 5"
"Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,","book 5"
"Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger","book 5"
"But with a grain a day, I would not buy","book 5"
"Their mercy at the price of one fair word;","book 5"
"Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,","book 5"
"To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"For that he has,","book 5"
"As much as in him lies, from time to time","book 5"
"Envied against the people, seeking means","book 5"
"To pluck away their power, as now at last","book 5"
"Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence","book 5"
"Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers","book 5"
"That do distribute it; in the name o' the people","book 5"
"And in the power of us the tribunes, we,","book 5"
"Even from this instant, banish him our city,","book 5"
"In peril of precipitation","book 5"
"From off the rock Tarpeian never more","book 5"
"To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,","book 5"
"I say it shall be so.","book 5"

"I have been consul, and can show for Rome","book 5"
"Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love","book 5"
"My country's good with a respect more tender,","book 5"
"More holy and profound, than mine own life,","book 5"
"My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,","book 5"
"And treasure of my loins; then if I would","book 5"
"Speak that,--","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"We know your drift: speak what?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,","book 5"
"As enemy to the people and his country:","book 5"
"It shall be so.","book 5"
"Citizens:","book 5"
"It shall be so, it shall be so.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate","book 5"
"As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize","book 5"
"As the dead carcasses of unburied men","book 5"
"That do corrupt my air, I banish you;","book 5"
"And here remain with your uncertainty!","book 5"
"Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!","book 5"
"Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,","book 5"
"Fan you into despair! Have the power still","book 5"
"To banish your defenders; till at length","book 5"
"Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,","book 5"
"Making not reservation of yourselves,","book 5"
"Still your own foes, deliver you as most","book 5"
"Abated captives to some nation","book 5"

"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,","book 5"

"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast","book 5"
"With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,","book 5"
"Where is your ancient courage? you were used","book 5"
"To say extremity was the trier of spirits;","book 5"
"That common chances common men could bear;","book 5"
"That when the sea was calm all boats alike","book 5"
"Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,","book 5"

"The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing","book 5"

"Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take","book 5"
"all power from the people and to pluck from them","book 5"

"Think me for the man I am, necessity","book 5"
"Commands me name myself.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"What is thy name?","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,","book 5"
"And harsh in sound to thine.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Say, what's thy name?","book 5"
"Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face","book 5"
"Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.","book 5"
"Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"

"thou me yet?","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"I know thee not: thy name?","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done","book 5"
"To thee particularly and to all the Volsces","book 5"
"Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may","book 5"
"My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,","book 5"
"The extreme dangers and the drops of blood","book 5"
"Shed for my thankless country are requited","book 5"
"But with that surname; a good memory,","book 5"
"And witness of the malice and displeasure","book 5"
"Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;","book 5"
"The cruelty and envy of the people,","book 5"
"Permitted by our dastard nobles, who","book 5"
"Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;","book 5"
"And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be","book 5"
"Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity","book 5"
"Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--","book 5"
"Mistake me not--to save my life, for if","book 5"
"I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world","book 5"
"I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,","book 5"
"To be full quit of those my banishers,","book 5"
"Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast","book 5"
"A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge","book 5"
"Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims","book 5"
"Of shame seen through thy country, speed","book 5"
"thee straight,","book 5"
"And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it","book 5"
"That my revengeful services may prove","book 5"
"As benefits to thee, for I will fight","book 5"
"Against my canker'd country with the spleen","book 5"
"Of all the under fiends. But if so be","book 5"
"Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes","book 5"
"Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am","book 5"
"Longer to live most weary, and present","book 5"
"My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;","book 5"
"Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,","book 5"
"Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,","book 5"
"Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,","book 5"
"And cannot live but to thy shame, unless","book 5"
"It be to do thee service.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"O Marcius, Marcius!","book 5"
"Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart","book 5"
"A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter","book 5"
"Should from yond cloud speak divine things,","book 5"
"And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more","book 5"
"Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine","book 5"
"Mine arms about that body, where against","book 5"
"My grained ash an hundred times hath broke","book 5"
"And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip","book 5"
"The anvil of my sword, and do contest","book 5"
"As hotly and as nobly with thy love","book 5"
"As ever in ambitious strength I did","book 5"
"Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,","book 5"
"I loved the maid I married; never man","book 5"
"Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,","book 5"
"Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart","book 5"
"Than when I first my wedded mistress saw","book 5"
"Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,","book 5"
"We have a power on foot; and I had purpose","book 5"
"Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,","book 5"
"Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out","book 5"
"Twelve several times, and I have nightly since","book 5"
"Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;","book 5"
"We have been down together in my sleep,","book 5"
"Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,","book 5"
"And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,","book 5"
"Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that","book 5"
"Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all","book 5"
"From twelve to seventy, and pouring war","book 5"
"Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,","book 5"
"Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,","book 5"
"And take our friendly senators by the hands;","book 5"
"Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,","book 5"
"Who am prepared against your territories,","book 5"
"Though not for Rome itself.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"You bless me, gods!","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have","book 5"
"The leading of thine own revenges, take","book 5"
"The one half of my commission; and set down--","book 5"
"As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st","book 5"
"Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;","book 5"
"Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,","book 5"
"Or rudely visit them in parts remote,","book 5"
"To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:","book 5"
"Let me commend thee first to those that shall","book 5"
"Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!","book 5"
"And more a friend than e'er an enemy;","book 5"
"Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"Here's a strange alteration!","book 5"
"Second Servingman:","book 5"
"By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with","book 5"
"a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a","book 5"
"false report of him.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"What an arm he has! he turned me about with his","book 5"
"finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.","book 5"
"Second Servingman:","book 5"
"Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in","book 5"
"him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I","book 5"
"cannot tell how to term it.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,","book 5"
"but I thought there was more in him than I could think.","book 5"
"Second Servingman:","book 5"
"So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest","book 5"
"man i' the world.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.","book 5"
"Second Servingman:","book 5"
"Who, my master?","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"Nay, it's no matter for that.","book 5"
"Second Servingman:","book 5"
"Worth six on him.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the","book 5"
"greater soldier.","book 5"
"Second Servingman:","book 5"
"Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:","book 5"
"for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"Ay, and for an assault too.","book 5"
"Third Servingman:","book 5"
"O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"What, what, what? let's partake.","book 5"
"Third Servingman:","book 5"
"I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as","book 5"
"lieve be a condemned man.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"Wherefore? wherefore?","book 5"
"Third Servingman:","book 5"
"Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,","book 5"
"Caius Marcius.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"Why do you say 'thwack our general '?","book 5"
"Third Servingman:","book 5"
"I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always","book 5"
"good enough for him.","book 5"
"Second Servingman:","book 5"
"Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too","book 5"
"hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth","book 5"
"on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched","book 5"
"him like a carbon ado.","book 5"
"Second Servingman:","book 5"
"An he had been cannibally given, he might have","book 5"
"broiled and eaten him too.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"But, more of thy news?","book 5"
"Third Servingman:","book 5"
"Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son","book 5"
"and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no","book 5"
"question asked him by any of the senators, but they","book 5"
"stand bald before him: our general himself makes a","book 5"
"mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and","book 5"
"turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But","book 5"
"the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'","book 5"
"the middle and but one half of what he was","book 5"
"yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty","book 5"
"and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,","book 5"
"and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he","book 5"
"will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.","book 5"
"Second Servingman:","book 5"
"And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.","book 5"
"Third Servingman:","book 5"
"Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as","book 5"
"many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it","book 5"
"were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as","book 5"
"we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"Directitude! what's that?","book 5"
"Third Servingman:","book 5"
"But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,","book 5"
"and the man in blood, they will out of their","book 5"
"burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with","book 5"
"him.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"But when goes this forward?","book 5"
"Third Servingman:","book 5"
"To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the","book 5"
"drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a","book 5"
"parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they","book 5"
"wipe their lips.","book 5"
"Second Servingman:","book 5"
"Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.","book 5"
"This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase","book 5"
"tailors, and breed ballad-makers.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as","book 5"
"day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and","book 5"
"full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;","book 5"
"mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more","book 5"
"bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.","book 5"
"Second Servingman:","book 5"
"'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to","book 5"
"be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a","book 5"
"great maker of cuckolds.","book 5"
"First Servingman:","book 5"
"Ay, and it makes men hate one another.","book 5"
"Third Servingman:","book 5"
"Reason; because they then less need one another.","book 5"
"The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap","book 5"
"as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.","book 5"
"All:","book 5"
"In, in, in, in!","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;","book 5"
"His remedies are tame i' the present peace","book 5"
"And quietness of the people, which before","book 5"
"Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends","book 5"
"Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,","book 5"
"Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold","book 5"
"Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see","book 5"
"Our tradesmen with in their shops and going","book 5"
"About their functions friendly.","book 5"

"Is this Menenius?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.","book 5"
"Both Tribunes:","book 5"
"Hail sir!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Hail to you both!","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Your Coriolanus","book 5"
"Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:","book 5"
"The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,","book 5"
"Were he more angry at it.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"All's well; and might have been much better, if","book 5"
"He could have temporized.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Where is he, hear you?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife","book 5"
"Hear nothing from him.","book 5"
"Citizens:","book 5"
"The gods preserve you both!","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"God-den, our neighbours.","book 5"

"God-den to you all, god-den to you all.","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,","book 5"
"Are bound to pray for you both.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Live, and thrive!","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus","book 5"
"Had loved you as we did.","book 5"
"Citizens:","book 5"
"Now the gods keep you!","book 5"
"Both Tribunes:","book 5"
"Farewell, farewell.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"This is a happier and more comely time","book 5"
"Than when these fellows ran about the streets,","book 5"
"Crying confusion.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Caius Marcius was","book 5"
"A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,","book 5"
"O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,","book 5"
"Self-loving,--","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"And affecting one sole throne,","book 5"
"Without assistance.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I think not so.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"We should by this, to all our lamentation,","book 5"
"If he had gone forth consul, found it so.","book 5"

"The gods have well prevented it, and Rome","book 5"

"'Tis Aufidius,","book 5"
"Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,","book 5"
"Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;","book 5"
"Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,","book 5"
"And durst not once peep out.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Come, what talk you","book 5"
"Of Marcius?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be","book 5"
"The Volsces dare break with us.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Cannot be!","book 5"
"We have record that very well it can,","book 5"
"And three examples of the like have been","book 5"
"Within my age. But reason with the fellow,","book 5"
"Before you punish him, where he heard this,","book 5"
"Lest you shall chance to whip your information","book 5"
"And beat the messenger who bids beware","book 5"
"Of what is to be dreaded.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Tell not me:","book 5"
"I know this cannot be.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Not possible.","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"The nobles in great earnestness are going","book 5"
"All to the senate-house: some news is come","book 5"
"That turns their countenances.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"'Tis this slave;--","book 5"
"Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;","book 5"
"Nothing but his report.","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"Yes, worthy sir,","book 5"
"The slave's report is seconded; and more,","book 5"
"More fearful, is deliver'd.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"What more fearful?","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"It is spoke freely out of many mouths--","book 5"
"How probable I do not know--that Marcius,","book 5"
"Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,","book 5"
"And vows revenge as spacious as between","book 5"
"The young'st and oldest thing.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"This is most likely!","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish","book 5"
"Good Marcius home again.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"The very trick on't.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"This is unlikely:","book 5"
"He and Aufidius can no more atone","book 5"
"Than violentest contrariety.","book 5"
"Second Messenger:","book 5"
"You are sent for to the senate:","book 5"
"A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius","book 5"
"Associated with Aufidius, rages","book 5"
"Upon our territories; and have already","book 5"
"O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took","book 5"
"What lay before them.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"O, you have made good work!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"What news? what news?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"You have holp to ravish your own daughters and","book 5"
"To melt the city leads upon your pates,","book 5"
"To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"What's the news? what's the news?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Your temples burned in their cement, and","book 5"
"Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined","book 5"
"Into an auger's bore.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Pray now, your news?","book 5"
"You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--","book 5"
"If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"If!","book 5"
"He is their god: he leads them like a thing","book 5"
"Made by some other deity than nature,","book 5"
"That shapes man better; and they follow him,","book 5"
"Against us brats, with no less confidence","book 5"
"Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,","book 5"
"Or butchers killing flies.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"You have made good work,","book 5"
"You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much","book 5"
"on the voice of occupation and","book 5"
"The breath of garlic-eaters!","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"He will shake","book 5"
"Your Rome about your ears.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"As Hercules","book 5"
"Did shake down mellow fruit.","book 5"
"You have made fair work!","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"But is this true, sir?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Ay; and you'll look pale","book 5"
"Before you find it other. All the regions","book 5"
"Do smilingly revolt; and who resist","book 5"
"Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,","book 5"
"And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?","book 5"
"Your enemies and his find something in him.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"We are all undone, unless","book 5"
"The noble man have mercy.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Who shall ask it?","book 5"
"The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people","book 5"
"Deserve such pity of him as the wolf","book 5"
"Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they","book 5"
"Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even","book 5"
"As those should do that had deserved his hate,","book 5"
"And therein show'd like enemies.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"'Tis true:","book 5"
"If he were putting to my house the brand","book 5"
"That should consume it, I have not the face","book 5"
"To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,","book 5"
"You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"You have brought","book 5"
"A trembling upon Rome, such as was never","book 5"
"So incapable of help.","book 5"
"Both Tribunes:","book 5"
"Say not we brought it.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts","book 5"
"And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,","book 5"
"Who did hoot him out o' the city.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"But I fear","book 5"
"They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,","book 5"
"The second name of men, obeys his points","book 5"
"As if he were his officer: desperation","book 5"
"Is all the policy, strength and defence,","book 5"
"That Rome can make against them.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Here come the clusters.","book 5"
"And is Aufidius with him? You are they","book 5"
"That made the air unwholesome, when you cast","book 5"
"Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at","book 5"
"Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;","book 5"
"And not a hair upon a soldier's head","book 5"
"Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs","book 5"
"As you threw caps up will he tumble down,","book 5"
"And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;","book 5"
"if he could burn us all into one coal,","book 5"
"We have deserved it.","book 5"
"Citizens:","book 5"
"Faith, we hear fearful news.","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"For mine own part,","book 5"
"When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"And so did I.","book 5"
"Third Citizen:","book 5"
"And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very","book 5"
"many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and","book 5"
"though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet","book 5"
"it was against our will.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Ye re goodly things, you voices!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"You have made","book 5"
"Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"O, ay, what else?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:","book 5"
"These are a side that would be glad to have","book 5"
"This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,","book 5"
"And show no sign of fear.","book 5"
"First Citizen:","book 5"
"The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.","book 5"
"I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished","book 5"
"him.","book 5"
"Second Citizen:","book 5"
"So did we all. But, come, let's home.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"I do not like this news.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Nor I.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth","book 5"
"Would buy this for a lie!","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Pray, let us go.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Do they still fly to the Roman?","book 5"
"Lieutenant:","book 5"
"I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but","book 5"
"Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,","book 5"
"Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;","book 5"
"And you are darken'd in this action, sir,","book 5"
"Even by your own.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"I cannot help it now,","book 5"
"Unless, by using means, I lame the foot","book 5"
"Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,","book 5"
"Even to my person, than I thought he would","book 5"
"When first I did embrace him: yet his nature","book 5"
"In that's no changeling; and I must excuse","book 5"
"What cannot be amended.","book 5"
"Lieutenant:","book 5"
"Yet I wish, sir,--","book 5"
"I mean for your particular,--you had not","book 5"
"Join'd in commission with him; but either","book 5"
"Had borne the action of yourself, or else","book 5"
"To him had left it solely.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"I understand thee well; and be thou sure,","book 5"
"when he shall come to his account, he knows not","book 5"
"What I can urge against him. Although it seems,","book 5"
"And so he thinks, and is no less apparent","book 5"
"To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.","book 5"
"And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,","book 5"
"Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon","book 5"
"As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone","book 5"
"That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,","book 5"
"Whene'er we come to our account.","book 5"
"Lieutenant:","book 5"
"Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"All places yield to him ere he sits down;","book 5"
"And the nobility of Rome are his:","book 5"
"The senators and patricians love him too:","book 5"
"The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people","book 5"
"Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty","book 5"
"To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome","book 5"
"As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it","book 5"
"By sovereignty of nature. First he was","book 5"
"A noble servant to them; but he could not","book 5"
"Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,","book 5"
"Which out of daily fortune ever taints","book 5"
"The happy man; whether defect of judgment,","book 5"
"To fail in the disposing of those chances","book 5"
"Which he was lord of; or whether nature,","book 5"
"Not to be other than one thing, not moving","book 5"
"From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace","book 5"
"Even with the same austerity and garb","book 5"
"As he controll'd the war; but one of these--","book 5"
"As he hath spices of them all, not all,","book 5"
"For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,","book 5"
"So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,","book 5"
"To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues","book 5"
"Lie in the interpretation of the time:","book 5"
"And power, unto itself most commendable,","book 5"
"Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair","book 5"
"To extol what it hath done.","book 5"
"One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;","book 5"
"Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.","book 5"
"Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,","book 5"
"Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said","book 5"
"Which was sometime his general; who loved him","book 5"
"In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:","book 5"
"But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;","book 5"
"A mile before his tent fall down, and knee","book 5"
"The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd","book 5"
"To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"He would not seem to know me.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Do you hear?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"Yet one time he did call me by my name:","book 5"
"I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops","book 5"
"That we have bled together. Coriolanus","book 5"
"He would not answer to: forbad all names;","book 5"
"He was a kind of nothing, titleless,","book 5"
"Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire","book 5"
"Of burning Rome.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Why, so: you have made good work!","book 5"
"A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,","book 5"
"To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon","book 5"
"When it was less expected: he replied,","book 5"
"It was a bare petition of a state","book 5"
"To one whom they had punish'd.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Very well:","book 5"
"Could he say less?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"I offer'd to awaken his regard","book 5"
"For's private friends: his answer to me was,","book 5"
"He could not stay to pick them in a pile","book 5"
"Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,","book 5"
"For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,","book 5"
"And still to nose the offence.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"For one poor grain or two!","book 5"
"I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,","book 5"
"And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:","book 5"
"You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt","book 5"
"Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid","book 5"
"In this so never-needed help, yet do not","book 5"
"Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you","book 5"
"Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,","book 5"
"More than the instant army we can make,","book 5"
"Might stop our countryman.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"No, I'll not meddle.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Pray you, go to him.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"What should I do?","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"Only make trial what your love can do","book 5"
"For Rome, towards Marcius.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Well, and say that Marcius","book 5"
"Return me, as Cominius is return'd,","book 5"
"Unheard; what then?","book 5"
"But as a discontented friend, grief-shot","book 5"
"With his unkindness? say't be so?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Yet your good will","book 5"
"must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure","book 5"
"As you intended well.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I'll undertake 't:","book 5"
"I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip","book 5"
"And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.","book 5"
"He was not taken well; he had not dined:","book 5"
"The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then","book 5"
"We pout upon the morning, are unapt","book 5"
"To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd","book 5"
"These and these conveyances of our blood","book 5"
"With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls","book 5"
"Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him","book 5"
"Till he be dieted to my request,","book 5"
"And then I'll set upon him.","book 5"
"BRUTUS:","book 5"
"You know the very road into his kindness,","book 5"
"And cannot lose your way.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Good faith, I'll prove him,","book 5"
"Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge","book 5"
"Of my success.","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"He'll never hear him.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Not?","book 5"
"COMINIUS:","book 5"
"I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye","book 5"
"Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury","book 5"
"The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;","book 5"
"'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me","book 5"
"Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,","book 5"
"He sent in writing after me; what he would not,","book 5"
"Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:","book 5"
"So that all hope is vain.","book 5"
"Unless his noble mother, and his wife;","book 5"
"Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him","book 5"
"For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,","book 5"
"And with our fair entreaties haste them on.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Stay: whence are you?","book 5"
"Second Senator:","book 5"
"Stand, and go back.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,","book 5"
"I am an officer of state, and come","book 5"
"To speak with Coriolanus.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"From whence?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"From Rome.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"You may not pass, you must return: our general","book 5"
"Will no more hear from thence.","book 5"
"Second Senator:","book 5"
"You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before","book 5"
"You'll speak with Coriolanus.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Good my friends,","book 5"
"If you have heard your general talk of Rome,","book 5"
"And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,","book 5"
"My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name","book 5"
"Is not here passable.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I tell thee, fellow,","book 5"
"The general is my lover: I have been","book 5"
"The book of his good acts, whence men have read","book 5"
"His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;","book 5"
"For I have ever verified my friends,","book 5"
"Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity","book 5"
"Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,","book 5"
"Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,","book 5"
"I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise","book 5"
"Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,","book 5"
"I must have leave to pass.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his","book 5"
"behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you","book 5"
"should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous","book 5"
"to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,","book 5"
"always factionary on the party of your general.","book 5"
"Second Senator:","book 5"
"Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you","book 5"
"have, I am one that, telling true under him, must","book 5"
"say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not","book 5"
"speak with him till after dinner.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"You are a Roman, are you?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I am, as thy general is.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,","book 5"
"when you have pushed out your gates the very","book 5"
"defender of them, and, in a violent popular","book 5"
"ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to","book 5"
"front his revenges with the easy groans of old","book 5"
"women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with","book 5"
"the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as","book 5"
"you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the","book 5"
"intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with","book 5"
"such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;","book 5"
"therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your","book 5"
"execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn","book 5"
"you out of reprieve and pardon.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would","book 5"
"use me with estimation.","book 5"
"Second Senator:","book 5"
"Come, my captain knows you not.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I mean, thy general.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest","book 5"
"I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's","book 5"
"the utmost of your having: back.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"What's the matter?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:","book 5"
"You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall","book 5"
"perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from","book 5"
"my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment","book 5"
"with him, if thou standest not i' the state of","book 5"
"hanging, or of some death more long in","book 5"
"spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now","book 5"
"presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.","book 5"
"The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy","book 5"
"particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than","book 5"
"thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!","book 5"
"thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's","book 5"
"water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to","book 5"
"thee; but being assured none but myself could move","book 5"
"thee, I have been blown out of your gates with","book 5"
"sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy","book 5"
"petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy","book 5"
"wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet","book 5"
"here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my","book 5"
"access to thee.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Away!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"How! away!","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs","book 5"
"Are servanted to others: though I owe","book 5"
"My revenge properly, my remission lies","book 5"
"In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,","book 5"
"Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather","book 5"
"Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.","book 5"
"Mine ears against your suits are stronger than","book 5"
"Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,","book 5"
"Take this along; I writ it for thy sake","book 5"
"And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,","book 5"
"I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,","book 5"
"Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"You keep a constant temper.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Now, sir, is your name Menenius?","book 5"
"Second Senator:","book 5"
"'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the","book 5"
"way home again.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your","book 5"
"greatness back?","book 5"

"This last old man,","book 5"
"Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,","book 5"
"Loved me above the measure of a father;","book 5"
"Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge","book 5"
"Was to send him; for whose old love I have,","book 5"
"Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd","book 5"
"The first conditions, which they did refuse","book 5"

"To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:","book 5"
"Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,","book 5"
"To imitate the graces of the gods;","book 5"
"To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,","book 5"
"And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt","book 5"
"That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?","book 5"
"Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man","book 5"
"Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:","book 5"
"He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:","book 5"
"Perhaps thy childishness will move him more","book 5"
"Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world","book 5"
"More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate","book 5"
"Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life","book 5"
"Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,","book 5"
"When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,","book 5"
"Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,","book 5"
"Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,","book 5"
"And spurn me back: but if it be not so,","book 5"
"Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,","book 5"
"That thou restrain'st from me the duty which","book 5"
"To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:","book 5"
"Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.","book 5"
"To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride","book 5"
"Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;","book 5"
"This is the last: so we will home to Rome,","book 5"
"And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:","book 5"
"This boy, that cannot tell what he would have","book 5"
"But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,","book 5"
"Does reason our petition with more strength","book 5"
"Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:","book 5"
"This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;","book 5"
"His wife is in Corioli and his child","book 5"
"Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:","book 5"
"I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,","book 5"
"And then I'll speak a little.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"O mother, mother!","book 5"
"What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,","book 5"
"The gods look down, and this unnatural scene","book 5"
"They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!","book 5"
"You have won a happy victory to Rome;","book 5"
"But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,","book 5"
"Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,","book 5"
"If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.","book 5"
"Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,","book 5"
"I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,","book 5"
"Were you in my stead, would you have heard","book 5"
"A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"I was moved withal.","book 5"

"I dare be sworn you were:","book 5"

"What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,","book 5"

"Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Ay, by and by;","book 5"
"But we will drink together; and you shall bear","book 5"
"A better witness back than words, which we,","book 5"
"On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.","book 5"
"Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve","book 5"
"To have a temple built you: all the swords","book 5"
"In Italy, and her confederate arms,","book 5"
"Could not have made this peace.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond","book 5"
"corner-stone?","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Why, what of that?","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"If it be possible for you to displace it with your","book 5"
"little finger, there is some hope the ladies of","book 5"
"Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.","book 5"
"But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are","book 5"
"sentenced and stay upon execution.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Is't possible that so short a time can alter the","book 5"
"condition of a man!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;","book 5"
"yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown","book 5"
"from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a","book 5"
"creeping thing.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"He loved his mother dearly.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother","book 5"
"now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness","book 5"
"of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he","book 5"
"moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before","book 5"
"his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with","book 5"
"his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a","book 5"
"battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for","book 5"
"Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with","book 5"
"his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity","book 5"
"and a heaven to throne in.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his","book 5"
"mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy","book 5"
"in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that","book 5"
"shall our poor city find: and all this is long of","book 5"
"you.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"The gods be good unto us!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto","book 5"
"us. When we banished him, we respected not them;","book 5"
"and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.","book 5"
"Messenger:","book 5"
"Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:","book 5"
"The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune","book 5"
"And hale him up and down, all swearing, if","book 5"
"The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,","book 5"
"They'll give him death by inches.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"What's the news?","book 5"
"Second Messenger:","book 5"
"Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,","book 5"
"The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:","book 5"
"A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,","book 5"
"No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"Friend,","book 5"
"Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?","book 5"
"Second Messenger:","book 5"
"As certain as I know the sun is fire:","book 5"
"Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?","book 5"
"Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,","book 5"
"As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!","book 5"
"The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,","book 5"
"Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,","book 5"
"Make the sun dance. Hark you!","book 5"
"MENENIUS:","book 5"
"This is good news:","book 5"
"I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia","book 5"
"Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,","book 5"
"A city full; of tribunes, such as you,","book 5"
"A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:","book 5"
"This morning for ten thousand of your throats","book 5"
"I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,","book 5"
"Accept my thankfulness.","book 5"
"Second Messenger:","book 5"
"Sir, we have all","book 5"
"Great cause to give great thanks.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"They are near the city?","book 5"
"Second Messenger:","book 5"
"Almost at point to enter.","book 5"
"SICINIUS:","book 5"
"We will meet them,","book 5"
"And help the joy.","book 5"
"First Senator:","book 5"
"Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!","book 5"
"Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,","book 5"
"And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:","book 5"
"Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,","book 5"
"Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;","book 5"
"Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'","book 5"
"All:","book 5"
"Welcome, ladies, Welcome!","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:","book 5"
"Deliver them this paper: having read it,","book 5"
"Bid them repair to the market place; where I,","book 5"
"Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,","book 5"
"Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse","book 5"
"The city ports by this hath enter'd and","book 5"
"Intends to appear before the people, hoping","book 5"
"To purge herself with words: dispatch.","book 5"
"Most welcome!","book 5"
"First Conspirator:","book 5"
"How is it with our general?","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Even so","book 5"
"As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,","book 5"
"And with his charity slain.","book 5"
"Second Conspirator:","book 5"
"Most noble sir,","book 5"
"If you do hold the same intent wherein","book 5"
"You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you","book 5"
"Of your great danger.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Sir, I cannot tell:","book 5"
"We must proceed as we do find the people.","book 5"
"Third Conspirator:","book 5"
"The people will remain uncertain whilst","book 5"
"'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either","book 5"
"Makes the survivor heir of all.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"I know it;","book 5"
"And my pretext to strike at him admits","book 5"
"A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd","book 5"
"Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,","book 5"
"He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,","book 5"
"Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,","book 5"
"He bow'd his nature, never known before","book 5"
"But to be rough, unswayable and free.","book 5"
"Third Conspirator:","book 5"
"Sir, his stoutness","book 5"
"When he did stand for consul, which he lost","book 5"
"By lack of stooping,--","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"That I would have spoke of:","book 5"
"Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;","book 5"
"Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;","book 5"
"Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way","book 5"
"In all his own desires; nay, let him choose","book 5"
"Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,","book 5"
"My best and freshest men; served his designments","book 5"
"In mine own person; holp to reap the fame","book 5"
"Which he did end all his; and took some pride","book 5"
"To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,","book 5"
"I seem'd his follower, not partner, and","book 5"
"He waged me with his countenance, as if","book 5"
"I had been mercenary.","book 5"
"First Conspirator:","book 5"
"So he did, my lord:","book 5"
"The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,","book 5"
"When he had carried Rome and that we look'd","book 5"
"For no less spoil than glory,--","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"There was it:","book 5"
"For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.","book 5"
"At a few drops of women's rheum, which are","book 5"
"As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour","book 5"
"Of our great action: therefore shall he die,","book 5"
"And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!","book 5"
"First Conspirator:","book 5"
"Your native town you enter'd like a post,","book 5"
"And had no welcomes home: but he returns,","book 5"
"Splitting the air with noise.","book 5"
"Second Conspirator:","book 5"
"And patient fools,","book 5"
"Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear","book 5"
"With giving him glory.","book 5"
"Third Conspirator:","book 5"
"Therefore, at your vantage,","book 5"
"Ere he express himself, or move the people","book 5"
"With what he would say, let him feel your sword,","book 5"
"Which we will second. When he lies along,","book 5"
"After your way his tale pronounced shall bury","book 5"
"His reasons with his body.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"Say no more:","book 5"
"Here come the lords.","book 5"
"All The Lords:","book 5"
"You are most welcome home.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"I have not deserved it.","book 5"
"But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused","book 5"
"What I have written to you?","book 5"
"Lords:","book 5"
"We have.","book 5"
"First Lord:","book 5"
"And grieve to hear't.","book 5"
"What faults he made before the last, I think","book 5"
"Might have found easy fines: but there to end","book 5"
"Where he was to begin and give away","book 5"
"The benefit of our levies, answering us","book 5"
"With our own charge, making a treaty where","book 5"
"There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.","book 5"
"AUFIDIUS:","book 5"
"He approaches: you shall hear him.","book 5"
"CORIOLANUS:","book 5"
"Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,","book 5"
"No more infected with my country's love","book 5"
"Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting","book 5"
"Under your great command. You are to know","book 5"
"That prosperously I have attempted and","book 5"
"With bloody passage led your wars even to","book 5"
"The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home","book 5"
"Do more than counterpoise a full third part","book 5"
"The charges of the action. We have made peace","book 5"
"With no less honour to the Antiates","book 5"
"Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,","book 5"
"Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,","book 5"
"Together with the seal o' the senate, what","book 5"

"As thou didst leave it.","book 6"

"For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--","book 6"
"Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,","book 6"
"Which smoked with bloody execution,","book 6"
"Like valour's minion carved out his passage","book 6"
"Till he faced the slave;","book 6"

"That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,","book 6"
"And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught","book 6"
"That man may question? You seem to understand me,","book 6"
"By each at once her chappy finger laying","book 6"
"Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,","book 6"

"That you are so.","book 6"

"Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner","book 6"
"You greet with present grace and great prediction","book 6"
"Of noble having and of royal hope,","book 6"
"That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.","book 6"
"If you can look into the seeds of time,","book 6"

"Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:","book 6"
"By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;","book 6"
"But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,","book 6"
"A prosperous gentleman; and to be king","book 6"
"Stands not within the prospect of belief,","book 6"
"No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence","book 6"
"You owe this strange intelligence? or why","book 6"
"Upon this blasted heath you stop our way","book 6"
"With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.","book 6"
"Witches vanish","book 6"

"The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,","book 6"
"And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?","book 6"

"Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted","book 6"
"As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"Were such things here as we do speak about?","book 6"

"You shall be king.","book 6"

"The news of thy success; and when he reads","book 6"
"Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,","book 6"
"His wonders and his praises do contend","book 6"
"Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,","book 6"
"In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,","book 6"
"He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,","book 6"
"Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,","book 6"
"Strange images of death. As thick as hail","book 6"
"Came post with post; and every one did bear","book 6"
"Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,","book 6"
"And pour'd them down before him.","book 6"
"ANGUS","book 6"
"We are sent","book 6"
"To give thee from our royal master thanks;","book 6"
"Only to herald thee into his sight,","book 6"
"Not pay thee.","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"And, for an earnest of a greater honour,","book 6"
"He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:","book 6"

"For it is thine.","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"What, can the devil speak true?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me","book 6"
"In borrow'd robes?","book 6"
"ANGUS","book 6"
"Who was the thane lives yet;","book 6"
"But under heavy judgment bears that life","book 6"
"Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined","book 6"
"With those of Norway, or did line the rebel","book 6"
"With hidden help and vantage, or that with both","book 6"
"He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;","book 6"

"To ROSS and ANGUS","book 6"
"Thanks for your pains.","book 6"
"To BANQUO","book 6"
"Do you not hope your children shall be kings,","book 6"
"When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me","book 6"
"Promised no less to them?","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"That trusted home","book 6"
"Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,","book 6"
"Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:","book 6"
"And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,","book 6"
"The instruments of darkness tell us truths,","book 6"
"Win us with honest trifles, to betray's","book 6"
"In deepest consequence.","book 6"
"Cousins, a word, I pray you.","book 6"

"Aside","book 6"
"Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,","book 6"
"Why hath it given me earnest of success,","book 6"
"Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:","book 6"
"If good, why do I yield to that suggestion","book 6"
"Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair","book 6"
"And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,","book 6"
"Against the use of nature? Present fears","book 6"
"Are less than horrible imaginings:","book 6"
"My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,","book 6"
"Shakes so my single state of man that function","book 6"
"Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is","book 6"
"But what is not.","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"Look, how our partner's rapt.","book 6"

"Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought","book 6"
"With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains","book 6"
"Are register'd where every day I turn","book 6"

"Implored your highness' pardon and set forth","book 6"
"A deep repentance: nothing in his life","book 6"
"Became him like the leaving it; he died","book 6"

"The sin of my ingratitude even now","book 6"

"DUNCAN","book 6"
"True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,","book 6"
"And in his commendations I am fed;","book 6"

"Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"'They met me in the day of success: and I have","book 6"
"learned by the perfectest report, they have more in","book 6"
"them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire","book 6"
"to question them further, they made themselves air,","book 6"
"into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in","book 6"
"the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who","book 6"
"all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,","book 6"
"before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred","book 6"
"me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that","book 6"
"shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver","book 6"
"thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou","book 6"
"mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being","book 6"
"ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it","book 6"
"to thy heart, and farewell.'","book 6"
"Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be","book 6"
"What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;","book 6"
"It is too full o' the milk of human kindness","book 6"
"To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;","book 6"
"Art not without ambition, but without","book 6"
"The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,","book 6"
"That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,","book 6"
"And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,","book 6"
"That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;","book 6"
"And that which rather thou dost fear to do","book 6"
"Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,","book 6"
"That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;","book 6"
"And chastise with the valour of my tongue","book 6"
"All that impedes thee from the golden round,","book 6"
"Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem","book 6"
"To have thee crown'd withal.","book 6"
"Enter a Messenger","book 6"
"What is your tidings?","book 6"
"Messenger","book 6"
"The king comes here to-night.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Thou'rt mad to say it:","book 6"
"Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,","book 6"
"Would have inform'd for preparation.","book 6"
"Messenger","book 6"
"So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:","book 6"
"One of my fellows had the speed of him,","book 6"
"Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more","book 6"
"Than would make up his message.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Give him tending;","book 6"
"He brings great news.","book 6"
"Exit Messenger","book 6"
"The raven himself is hoarse","book 6"

"That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,","book 6"
"And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full","book 6"
"Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;","book 6"
"Stop up the access and passage to remorse,","book 6"
"That no compunctious visitings of nature","book 6"

"The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,","book 6"
"And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,","book 6"
"Wherever in your sightless substances","book 6"
"You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,","book 6"
"And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,","book 6"

"To-morrow, as he purposes.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"O, never","book 6"
"Shall sun that morrow see!","book 6"

"Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself","book 6"
"Unto our gentle senses.","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"This guest of summer,","book 6"
"The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,","book 6"
"By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath","book 6"
"Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,","book 6"
"Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird","book 6"
"Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:","book 6"
"Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,","book 6"
"The air is delicate.","book 6"
"Enter LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"DUNCAN","book 6"
"See, see, our honour'd hostess!","book 6"
"The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,","book 6"
"Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you","book 6"
"How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,","book 6"
"And thank us for your trouble.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"All our service","book 6"
"In every point twice done and then done double","book 6"
"Were poor and single business to contend","book 6"
"Against those honours deep and broad wherewith","book 6"

"And the late dignities heap'd up to them,","book 6"
"We rest your hermits.","book 6"
"DUNCAN","book 6"
"Where's the thane of Cawdor?","book 6"
"We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose","book 6"
"To be his purveyor: but he rides well;","book 6"

"To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,","book 6"
"We are your guest to-night.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Your servants ever","book 6"

"To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,","book 6"
"Still to return your own.","book 6"
"DUNCAN","book 6"
"Give me your hand;","book 6"

"Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return","book 6"
"To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice","book 6"
"Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice","book 6"

"First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,","book 6"
"Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,","book 6"
"Who should against his murderer shut the door,","book 6"
"Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan","book 6"
"Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been","book 6"
"So clear in his great office, that his virtues","book 6"
"Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against","book 6"
"The deep damnation of his taking-off;","book 6"
"And pity, like a naked new-born babe,","book 6"
"Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed","book 6"
"Upon the sightless couriers of the air,","book 6"
"Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,","book 6"
"That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur","book 6"

"How now! what news?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?","book 6"

"Hath he ask'd for me?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Know you not he has?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"We will proceed no further in this business:","book 6"
"He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought","book 6"
"Golden opinions from all sorts of people,","book 6"
"Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,","book 6"
"Not cast aside so soon.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Was the hope drunk","book 6"
"Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?","book 6"
"And wakes it now, to look so green and pale","book 6"
"At what it did so freely? From this time","book 6"
"Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard","book 6"
"To be the same in thine own act and valour","book 6"
"As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that","book 6"
"Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,","book 6"
"And live a coward in thine own esteem,","book 6"
"Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'","book 6"
"Like the poor cat i' the adage?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Prithee, peace:","book 6"
"I dare do all that may become a man;","book 6"
"Who dares do more is none.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"What beast was't, then,","book 6"
"That made you break this enterprise to me?","book 6"
"When you durst do it, then you were a man;","book 6"
"And, to be more than what you were, you would","book 6"
"Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place","book 6"
"Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:","book 6"
"They have made themselves, and that their fitness now","book 6"
"Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know","book 6"
"How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:","book 6"
"I would, while it was smiling in my face,","book 6"
"Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,","book 6"
"And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you","book 6"
"Have done to this.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"If we should fail?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"We fail!","book 6"
"But screw your courage to the sticking-place,","book 6"
"And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--","book 6"
"Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey","book 6"
"Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains","book 6"
"Will I with wine and wassail so convince","book 6"
"That memory, the warder of the brain,","book 6"
"Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason","book 6"
"A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep","book 6"
"Their drenched natures lie as in a death,","book 6"
"What cannot you and I perform upon","book 6"
"The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon","book 6"
"His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt","book 6"
"Of our great quell?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Bring forth men-children only;","book 6"
"For thy undaunted mettle should compose","book 6"
"Nothing but males. Will it not be received,","book 6"
"When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two","book 6"
"Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,","book 6"
"That they have done't?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Who dares receive it other,","book 6"
"As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar","book 6"
"Upon his death?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"I am settled, and bend up","book 6"
"Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.","book 6"

"The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.","book 6"

"And she goes down at twelve.","book 6"

"I take't, 'tis later, sir.","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;","book 6"
"Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.","book 6"
"A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,","book 6"
"And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,","book 6"
"Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature","book 6"
"Gives way to in repose!","book 6"
"Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch","book 6"
"Give me my sword.","book 6"
"Who's there?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"A friend.","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:","book 6"
"He hath been in unusual pleasure, and","book 6"
"Sent forth great largess to your offices.","book 6"
"This diamond he greets your wife withal,","book 6"
"By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up","book 6"
"In measureless content.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Being unprepared,","book 6"
"Our will became the servant to defect;","book 6"
"Which else should free have wrought.","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"All's well.","book 6"
"I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:","book 6"
"To you they have show'd some truth.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"I think not of them:","book 6"
"Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,","book 6"
"We would spend it in some words upon that business,","book 6"
"If you would grant the time.","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"At your kind'st leisure.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,","book 6"
"It shall make honour for you.","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"So I lose none","book 6"
"In seeking to augment it, but still keep","book 6"
"My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,","book 6"
"I shall be counsell'd.","book 6"

"Exit Servant","book 6"
"Is this a dagger which I see before me,","book 6"
"The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.","book 6"
"I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.","book 6"
"Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible","book 6"
"To feeling as to sight? or art thou but","book 6"
"A dagger of the mind, a false creation,","book 6"
"Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?","book 6"
"I see thee yet, in form as palpable","book 6"
"As this which now I draw.","book 6"
"Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;","book 6"
"And such an instrument I was to use.","book 6"
"Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,","book 6"
"Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,","book 6"
"And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,","book 6"
"Which was not so before. There's no such thing:","book 6"
"It is the bloody business which informs","book 6"
"Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld","book 6"
"Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse","book 6"
"The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates","book 6"
"Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,","book 6"
"Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,","book 6"
"Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.","book 6"
"With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design","book 6"
"Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,","book 6"
"Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear","book 6"
"Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,","book 6"
"And take the present horror from the time,","book 6"
"Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:","book 6"
"Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.","book 6"
"A bell rings","book 6"
"I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.","book 6"
"Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell","book 6"

"Exit","book 6"
"SCENE II. The same.","book 6"
"Enter LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;","book 6"
"What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.","book 6"
"Hark! Peace!","book 6"
"It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,","book 6"
"Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:","book 6"
"The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms","book 6"
"Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd","book 6"
"their possets,","book 6"
"That death and nature do contend about them,","book 6"
"Whether they live or die.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"[Within] Who's there? what, ho!","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,","book 6"
"And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed","book 6"
"Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;","book 6"
"He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled","book 6"
"My father as he slept, I had done't.","book 6"
"Enter MACBETH","book 6"
"My husband!","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.","book 6"
"Did not you speak?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"When?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Now.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"As I descended?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Ay.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Hark!","book 6"
"Who lies i' the second chamber?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Donalbain.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"This is a sorry sight.","book 6"
"Looking on his hands","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried","book 6"
"'Murder!'","book 6"
"That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:","book 6"
"But they did say their prayers, and address'd them","book 6"
"Again to sleep.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"There are two lodged together.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;","book 6"
"As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.","book 6"
"Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'","book 6"
"When they did say 'God bless us!'","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Consider it not so deeply.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?","book 6"
"I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'","book 6"
"Stuck in my throat.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"These deeds must not be thought","book 6"
"After these ways; so, it will make us mad.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!","book 6"
"Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,","book 6"
"Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,","book 6"
"The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,","book 6"
"Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,","book 6"
"Chief nourisher in life's feast,--","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"What do you mean?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:","book 6"
"'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor","book 6"
"Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,","book 6"
"You do unbend your noble strength, to think","book 6"
"So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,","book 6"
"And wash this filthy witness from your hand.","book 6"
"Why did you bring these daggers from the place?","book 6"
"They must lie there: go carry them; and smear","book 6"
"The sleepy grooms with blood.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"I'll go no more:","book 6"
"I am afraid to think what I have done;","book 6"
"Look on't again I dare not.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Infirm of purpose!","book 6"
"Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead","book 6"
"Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood","book 6"
"That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,","book 6"
"I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;","book 6"
"For it must seem their guilt.","book 6"
"Exit. Knocking within","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Whence is that knocking?","book 6"
"How is't with me, when every noise appals me?","book 6"
"What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.","book 6"
"Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood","book 6"
"Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather","book 6"
"The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,","book 6"
"Making the green one red.","book 6"
"Re-enter LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"My hands are of your colour; but I shame","book 6"
"To wear a heart so white.","book 6"
"Knocking within","book 6"
"I hear a knocking","book 6"
"At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;","book 6"
"A little water clears us of this deed:","book 6"
"How easy is it, then! Your constancy","book 6"
"Hath left you unattended.","book 6"
"Knocking within","book 6"
"Hark! more knocking.","book 6"
"Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,","book 6"
"And show us to be watchers. Be not lost","book 6"
"So poorly in your thoughts.","book 6"

"Porter","book 6"

"it provokes the desire, but it takes","book 6"

"may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:","book 6"

"MALCOLM","book 6"

"To Ireland, I; our separated fortune","book 6"

"Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,","book 6"
"Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,","book 6"
"And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:","book 6"

"That darkness does the face of earth entomb,","book 6"
"When living light should kiss it?","book 6"
"Old Man","book 6"
"'Tis unnatural,","book 6"
"Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,","book 6"
"A falcon, towering in her pride of place,","book 6"
"Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--","book 6"
"Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,","book 6"

"Old Man","book 6"
"'Tis said they eat each other.","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes","book 6"

"ROSS","book 6"
"Alas, the day!","book 6"
"What good could they pretend?","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"They were suborn'd:","book 6"
"Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,","book 6"

"As the weird women promised, and, I fear,","book 6"
"Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said","book 6"
"It should not stand in thy posterity,","book 6"
"But that myself should be the root and father","book 6"
"Of many kings. If there come truth from them--","book 6"
"As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--","book 6"
"Why, by the verities on thee made good,","book 6"
"May they not be my oracles as well,","book 6"

"Ride you this afternoon?","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"Ay, my good lord.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"We should have else desired your good advice,","book 6"
"Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,","book 6"
"In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.","book 6"
"Is't far you ride?","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"As far, my lord, as will fill up the time","book 6"
"'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,","book 6"

"My lord, I will not.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd","book 6"
"In England and in Ireland, not confessing","book 6"
"Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers","book 6"
"With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,","book 6"

"Bring them before us.","book 6"
"Exit Attendant","book 6"
"To be thus is nothing;","book 6"
"But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo","book 6"
"Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature","book 6"

"And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,","book 6"
"He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour","book 6"

"Whose being I do fear: and, under him,","book 6"
"My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,","book 6"
"Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters","book 6"
"When first they put the name of king upon me,","book 6"
"And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like","book 6"
"They hail'd him father to a line of kings:","book 6"
"Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,","book 6"
"And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,","book 6"
"Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,","book 6"
"No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,","book 6"
"For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;","book 6"
"For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;","book 6"
"Put rancours in the vessel of my peace","book 6"
"Only for them; and mine eternal jewel","book 6"
"Given to the common enemy of man,","book 6"
"To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!","book 6"

"MACBETH","book 6"
"Well then, now","book 6"
"Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know","book 6"
"That it was he in the times past which held you","book 6"
"So under fortune, which you thought had been","book 6"
"Our innocent self: this I made good to you","book 6"
"In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,","book 6"
"How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,","book 6"

"Say 'Thus did Banquo.'","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"You made it known to us.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"I did so, and went further, which is now","book 6"
"Our point of second meeting. Do you find","book 6"
"Your patience so predominant in your nature","book 6"
"That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd","book 6"
"To pray for this good man and for his issue,","book 6"
"Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave","book 6"
"And beggar'd yours for ever?","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"We are men, my liege.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;","book 6"
"As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,","book 6"
"Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept","book 6"
"All by the name of dogs: the valued file","book 6"
"Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,","book 6"
"The housekeeper, the hunter, every one","book 6"
"According to the gift which bounteous nature","book 6"
"Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive","book 6"
"Particular addition. from the bill","book 6"
"That writes them all alike: and so of men.","book 6"
"Now, if you have a station in the file,","book 6"
"Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;","book 6"
"And I will put that business in your bosoms,","book 6"
"Whose execution takes your enemy off,","book 6"
"Grapples you to the heart and love of us,","book 6"
"Who wear our health but sickly in his life,","book 6"
"Which in his death were perfect.","book 6"
"Second Murderer","book 6"
"I am one, my liege,","book 6"
"Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world","book 6"
"Have so incensed that I am reckless what","book 6"
"I do to spite the world.","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"And I another","book 6"
"So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,","book 6"
"That I would set my lie on any chance,","book 6"
"To mend it, or be rid on't.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Both of you","book 6"
"Know Banquo was your enemy.","book 6"
"Both Murderers","book 6"
"True, my lord.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,","book 6"
"That every minute of his being thrusts","book 6"
"Against my near'st of life: and though I could","book 6"
"With barefaced power sweep him from my sight","book 6"
"And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,","book 6"
"For certain friends that are both his and mine,","book 6"
"Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall","book 6"
"Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,","book 6"
"That I to your assistance do make love,","book 6"
"Masking the business from the common eye","book 6"
"For sundry weighty reasons.","book 6"
"Second Murderer","book 6"
"We shall, my lord,","book 6"

"First Murderer","book 6"
"Though our lives--","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most","book 6"
"I will advise you where to plant yourselves;","book 6"
"Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,","book 6"
"The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,","book 6"
"And something from the palace; always thought","book 6"

"To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--","book 6"
"Fleance his son, that keeps him company,","book 6"
"Whose absence is no less material to me","book 6"

"Both Murderers","book 6"
"We are resolved, my lord.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"I'll call upon you straight: abide within.","book 6"

"Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Is Banquo gone from court?","book 6"
"Servant","book 6"
"Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Say to the king, I would attend his leisure","book 6"
"For a few words.","book 6"
"Servant","book 6"
"Madam, I will.","book 6"
"Exit","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Nought's had, all's spent,","book 6"
"Where our desire is got without content:","book 6"
"'Tis safer to be that which we destroy","book 6"
"Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.","book 6"
"Enter MACBETH","book 6"
"How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,","book 6"
"Of sorriest fancies your companions making,","book 6"
"Using those thoughts which should indeed have died","book 6"
"With them they think on? Things without all remedy","book 6"
"Should be without regard: what's done is done.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:","book 6"
"She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice","book 6"
"Remains in danger of her former tooth.","book 6"
"But let the frame of things disjoint, both the","book 6"
"worlds suffer,","book 6"
"Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep","book 6"
"In the affliction of these terrible dreams","book 6"
"That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,","book 6"
"Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,","book 6"
"Than on the torture of the mind to lie","book 6"
"In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;","book 6"
"After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;","book 6"
"Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,","book 6"
"Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,","book 6"
"Can touch him further.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Come on;","book 6"
"Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;","book 6"
"Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:","book 6"
"Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;","book 6"
"Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:","book 6"
"Unsafe the while, that we","book 6"
"Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,","book 6"
"And make our faces vizards to our hearts,","book 6"
"Disguising what they are.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"You must leave this.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!","book 6"
"Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"But in them nature's copy's not eterne.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"There's comfort yet; they are assailable;","book 6"
"Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown","book 6"
"His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons","book 6"
"The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums","book 6"
"Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done","book 6"
"A deed of dreadful note.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"What's to be done?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,","book 6"
"Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,","book 6"
"Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;","book 6"
"And with thy bloody and invisible hand","book 6"
"Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond","book 6"
"Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow","book 6"
"Makes wing to the rooky wood:","book 6"
"Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;","book 6"
"While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.","book 6"
"Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;","book 6"
"Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.","book 6"
"So, prithee, go with me.","book 6"

"He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers","book 6"
"Our offices and what we have to do","book 6"
"To the direction just.","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"Then stand with us.","book 6"
"The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:","book 6"
"Now spurs the lated traveller apace","book 6"
"To gain the timely inn; and near approaches","book 6"
"The subject of our watch.","book 6"
"Third Murderer","book 6"
"Hark! I hear horses.","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"[Within] Give us a light there, ho!","book 6"
"Second Murderer","book 6"
"Then 'tis he: the rest","book 6"
"That are within the note of expectation","book 6"
"Already are i' the court.","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"His horses go about.","book 6"
"Third Murderer","book 6"
"Almost a mile: but he does usually,","book 6"
"So all men do, from hence to the palace gate","book 6"
"Make it their walk.","book 6"
"Second Murderer","book 6"
"A light, a light!","book 6"
"Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch","book 6"
"Third Murderer","book 6"
"'Tis he.","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"Stand to't.","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"It will be rain to-night.","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"Let it come down.","book 6"
"They set upon BANQUO","book 6"
"BANQUO","book 6"
"O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!","book 6"
"Thou mayst revenge. O slave!","book 6"
"Dies. FLEANCE escapes","book 6"
"Third Murderer","book 6"
"Who did strike out the light?","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"Wast not the way?","book 6"
"Third Murderer","book 6"
"There's but one down; the son is fled.","book 6"
"Second Murderer","book 6"
"We have lost","book 6"
"Best half of our affair.","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"Well, let's away, and say how much is done.","book 6"
"Exeunt","book 6"

"A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"You know your own degrees; sit down: at first","book 6"
"And last the hearty welcome.","book 6"
"Lords","book 6"
"Thanks to your majesty.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Ourself will mingle with society,","book 6"
"And play the humble host.","book 6"
"Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time","book 6"
"We will require her welcome.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;","book 6"
"For my heart speaks they are welcome.","book 6"
"First Murderer appears at the door","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.","book 6"
"Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:","book 6"
"Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure","book 6"
"The table round.","book 6"
"Approaching the door","book 6"
"There's blood on thy face.","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"'Tis Banquo's then.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"'Tis better thee without than he within.","book 6"
"Is he dispatch'd?","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good","book 6"
"That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,","book 6"
"Thou art the nonpareil.","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"Most royal sir,","book 6"
"Fleance is 'scaped.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,","book 6"
"Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,","book 6"
"As broad and general as the casing air:","book 6"
"But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in","book 6"
"To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?","book 6"
"First Murderer","book 6"
"Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,","book 6"
"With twenty trenched gashes on his head;","book 6"
"The least a death to nature.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Thanks for that:","book 6"
"There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled","book 6"
"Hath nature that in time will venom breed,","book 6"
"No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow","book 6"
"We'll hear, ourselves, again.","book 6"
"Exit Murderer","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"My royal lord,","book 6"
"You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold","book 6"
"That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,","book 6"
"'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;","book 6"
"From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;","book 6"
"Meeting were bare without it.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Sweet remembrancer!","book 6"
"Now, good digestion wait on appetite,","book 6"
"And health on both!","book 6"
"LENNOX","book 6"
"May't please your highness sit.","book 6"
"The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's place","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,","book 6"
"Were the graced person of our Banquo present;","book 6"
"Who may I rather challenge for unkindness","book 6"
"Than pity for mischance!","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"His absence, sir,","book 6"
"Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness","book 6"
"To grace us with your royal company.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"The table's full.","book 6"
"LENNOX","book 6"
"Here is a place reserved, sir.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Where?","book 6"
"LENNOX","book 6"
"Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Which of you have done this?","book 6"
"Lords","book 6"
"What, my good lord?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Thou canst not say I did it: never shake","book 6"
"Thy gory locks at me.","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,","book 6"
"And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;","book 6"
"The fit is momentary; upon a thought","book 6"
"He will again be well: if much you note him,","book 6"
"You shall offend him and extend his passion:","book 6"
"Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that","book 6"
"Which might appal the devil.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"O proper stuff!","book 6"
"This is the very painting of your fear:","book 6"
"This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,","book 6"
"Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,","book 6"
"Impostors to true fear, would well become","book 6"
"A woman's story at a winter's fire,","book 6"
"Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!","book 6"
"Why do you make such faces? When all's done,","book 6"
"You look but on a stool.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!","book 6"
"how say you?","book 6"
"Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.","book 6"
"If charnel-houses and our graves must send","book 6"
"Those that we bury back, our monuments","book 6"
"Shall be the maws of kites.","book 6"
"GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"What, quite unmann'd in folly?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"If I stand here, I saw him.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Fie, for shame!","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,","book 6"
"Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;","book 6"
"Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd","book 6"
"Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,","book 6"
"That, when the brains were out, the man would die,","book 6"
"And there an end; but now they rise again,","book 6"
"With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,","book 6"
"And push us from our stools: this is more strange","book 6"
"Than such a murder is.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"My worthy lord,","book 6"
"Your noble friends do lack you.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"I do forget.","book 6"
"Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,","book 6"
"I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing","book 6"
"To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;","book 6"
"Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.","book 6"
"I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,","book 6"
"And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;","book 6"
"Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,","book 6"
"And all to all.","book 6"
"Lords","book 6"
"Our duties, and the pledge.","book 6"
"Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!","book 6"
"Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;","book 6"
"Thou hast no speculation in those eyes","book 6"
"Which thou dost glare with!","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Think of this, good peers,","book 6"
"But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;","book 6"
"Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"What man dare, I dare:","book 6"
"Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,","book 6"
"The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;","book 6"
"Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves","book 6"
"Shall never tremble: or be alive again,","book 6"
"And dare me to the desert with thy sword;","book 6"
"If trembling I inhabit then, protest me","book 6"
"The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!","book 6"
"Unreal mockery, hence!","book 6"
"GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes","book 6"
"Why, so: being gone,","book 6"
"I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,","book 6"
"With most admired disorder.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Can such things be,","book 6"
"And overcome us like a summer's cloud,","book 6"
"Without our special wonder? You make me strange","book 6"
"Even to the disposition that I owe,","book 6"
"When now I think you can behold such sights,","book 6"
"And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,","book 6"
"When mine is blanched with fear.","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"What sights, my lord?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;","book 6"
"Question enrages him. At once, good night:","book 6"
"Stand not upon the order of your going,","book 6"
"But go at once.","book 6"
"LENNOX","book 6"
"Good night; and better health","book 6"
"Attend his majesty!","book 6"

"A kind good night to all!","book 6"
"Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH","book 6"

"It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:","book 6"
"Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;","book 6"
"Augurs and understood relations have","book 6"
"By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth","book 6"
"The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Almost at odds with morning, which is which.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person","book 6"
"At our great bidding?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Did you send to him, sir?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"I hear it by the way; but I will send:","book 6"
"There's not a one of them but in his house","book 6"
"I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,","book 6"
"And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:","book 6"
"More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,","book 6"
"By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,","book 6"
"All causes shall give way: I am in blood","book 6"
"Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,","book 6"
"Returning were as tedious as go o'er:","book 6"
"Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;","book 6"
"Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"You lack the season of all natures, sleep.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse","book 6"

"Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.","book 6"
"HECATE","book 6"
"Have I not reason, beldams as you are,","book 6"
"Saucy and overbold? How did you dare","book 6"
"To trade and traffic with Macbeth","book 6"
"In riddles and affairs of death;","book 6"
"And I, the mistress of your charms,","book 6"
"The close contriver of all harms,","book 6"
"Was never call'd to bear my part,","book 6"
"Or show the glory of our art?","book 6"
"And, which is worse, all you have done","book 6"
"Hath been but for a wayward son,","book 6"
"Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,","book 6"
"Loves for his own ends, not for you.","book 6"
"But make amends now: get you gone,","book 6"
"And at the pit of Acheron","book 6"
"Meet me i' the morning: thither he","book 6"
"Will come to know his destiny:","book 6"
"Your vessels and your spells provide,","book 6"
"Your charms and every thing beside.","book 6"
"I am for the air; this night I'll spend","book 6"
"Unto a dismal and a fatal end:","book 6"
"Great business must be wrought ere noon:","book 6"
"Upon the corner of the moon","book 6"
"There hangs a vaporous drop profound;","book 6"
"I'll catch it ere it come to ground:","book 6"
"And that distill'd by magic sleights","book 6"
"Shall raise such artificial sprites","book 6"
"As by the strength of their illusion","book 6"
"Shall draw him on to his confusion:","book 6"
"He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear","book 6"
"He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:","book 6"
"And you all know, security","book 6"
"Is mortals' chiefest enemy.","book 6"

"LENNOX","book 6"
"My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,","book 6"
"Which can interpret further: only, I say,","book 6"
"Things have been strangely borne. The","book 6"
"gracious Duncan","book 6"
"Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:","book 6"
"And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;","book 6"
"Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,","book 6"
"For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.","book 6"
"Who cannot want the thought how monstrous","book 6"
"It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain","book 6"
"To kill their gracious father? damned fact!","book 6"
"How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight","book 6"
"In pious rage the two delinquents tear,","book 6"
"That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?","book 6"
"Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;","book 6"
"For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive","book 6"
"To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,","book 6"
"He has borne all things well: and I do think","book 6"
"That had he Duncan's sons under his key--","book 6"
"As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they","book 6"
"should find","book 6"
"What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.","book 6"
"But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd","book 6"
"His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear","book 6"
"Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell","book 6"
"Where he bestows himself?","book 6"
"Lord","book 6"
"The son of Duncan,","book 6"
"From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth","book 6"
"Lives in the English court, and is received","book 6"
"Of the most pious Edward with such grace","book 6"
"That the malevolence of fortune nothing","book 6"
"Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff","book 6"
"Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid","book 6"
"To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:","book 6"
"That, by the help of these--with Him above","book 6"
"To ratify the work--we may again","book 6"
"Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,","book 6"
"Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,","book 6"
"Do faithful homage and receive free honours:","book 6"
"All which we pine for now: and this report","book 6"
"Hath so exasperate the king that he","book 6"
"Prepares for some attempt of war.","book 6"
"LENNOX","book 6"
"Sent he to Macduff?","book 6"
"Lord","book 6"
"He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'","book 6"
"The cloudy messenger turns me his back,","book 6"
"And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time","book 6"
"That clogs me with this answer.'","book 6"
"LENNOX","book 6"
"And that well might","book 6"
"Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance","book 6"
"His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel","book 6"
"Fly to the court of England and unfold","book 6"
"His message ere he come, that a swift blessing","book 6"

"Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.","book 6"

"What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.","book 6"
"This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,","book 6"
"Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.","book 6"
"He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;","book 6"

"Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,","book 6"
"Without leave-taking? I pray you,","book 6"
"Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,","book 6"

"I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;","book 6"
"It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash","book 6"
"Is added to her wounds: I think withal","book 6"
"There would be hands uplifted in my right;","book 6"
"And here from gracious England have I offer","book 6"
"Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,","book 6"
"When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,","book 6"
"Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country","book 6"
"Shall have more vices than it had before,","book 6"

"As will to greatness dedicate themselves,","book 6"
"Finding it so inclined.","book 6"
"MALCOLM","book 6"
"With this there grows","book 6"
"In my most ill-composed affection such","book 6"
"A stanchless avarice that, were I king,","book 6"
"I should cut off the nobles for their lands,","book 6"
"Desire his jewels and this other's house:","book 6"
"And my more-having would be as a sauce","book 6"
"To make me hunger more; that I should forge","book 6"
"Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,","book 6"
"Destroying them for wealth.","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"This avarice","book 6"
"Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root","book 6"
"Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been","book 6"
"The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;","book 6"
"Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.","book 6"
"Of your mere own: all these are portable,","book 6"
"With other graces weigh'd.","book 6"
"MALCOLM","book 6"
"But I have none: the king-becoming graces,","book 6"
"As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,","book 6"

"Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,","book 6"
"I have no relish of them, but abound","book 6"

"When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,","book 6"
"Since that the truest issue of thy throne","book 6"
"By his own interdiction stands accursed,","book 6"
"And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father","book 6"

"Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls","book 6"

"Exit Doctor","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"What's the disease he means?","book 6"
"MALCOLM","book 6"
"'Tis call'd the evil:","book 6"
"A most miraculous work in this good king;","book 6"
"Which often, since my here-remain in England,","book 6"
"I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,","book 6"
"Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,","book 6"
"All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,","book 6"
"The mere despair of surgery, he cures,","book 6"
"Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,","book 6"
"Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,","book 6"

"Stands Scotland where it did?","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"Alas, poor country!","book 6"
"Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot","book 6"

"Why, well.","book 6"

"The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"

"MACDUFF","book 6"
"But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"When I came hither to transport the tidings,","book 6"
"Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour","book 6"
"Of many worthy fellows that were out;","book 6"
"Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,","book 6"
"For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:","book 6"
"Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland","book 6"

"ROSS","book 6"
"Would I could answer","book 6"
"This comfort with the like! But I have words","book 6"

"MACDUFF","book 6"
"What concern they?","book 6"
"The general cause? or is it a fee-grief","book 6"
"Due to some single breast?","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"No mind that's honest","book 6"
"But in it shares some woe; though the main part","book 6"
"Pertains to you alone.","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"If it be mine,","book 6"
"Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,","book 6"

"ROSS","book 6"
"Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes","book 6"
"Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,","book 6"

"Merciful heaven!","book 6"
"What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;","book 6"

"He has no children. All my pretty ones?","book 6"
"Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?","book 6"
"What, all my pretty chickens and their dam","book 6"
"At one fell swoop?","book 6"
"MALCOLM","book 6"
"Dispute it like a man.","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"I shall do so;","book 6"
"But I must also feel it as a man:","book 6"
"I cannot but remember such things were,","book 6"
"That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,","book 6"
"And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,","book 6"
"They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,","book 6"
"Not for their own demerits, but for mine,","book 6"
"Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!","book 6"

"Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive","book 6"
"no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?","book 6"
"Gentlewoman","book 6"
"Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen","book 6"
"her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon","book 6"
"her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,","book 6"
"write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again","book 6"
"return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once","book 6"
"the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of","book 6"
"watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her","book 6"
"walking and other actual performances, what, at any","book 6"
"time, have you heard her say?","book 6"
"Gentlewoman","book 6"
"That, sir, which I will not report after her.","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.","book 6"
"Gentlewoman","book 6"
"Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to","book 6"
"confirm my speech.","book 6"
"Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper","book 6"
"Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;","book 6"
"and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"How came she by that light?","book 6"
"Gentlewoman","book 6"
"Why, it stood by her: she has light by her","book 6"
"continually; 'tis her command.","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"You see, her eyes are open.","book 6"
"Gentlewoman","book 6"
"Ay, but their sense is shut.","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.","book 6"
"Gentlewoman","book 6"
"It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus","book 6"
"washing her hands: I have known her continue in","book 6"
"this a quarter of an hour.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Yet here's a spot.","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from","book 6"
"her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,","book 6"
"then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my","book 6"
"lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we","book 6"
"fear who knows it, when none can call our power to","book 6"
"account?--Yet who would have thought the old man","book 6"
"to have had so much blood in him.","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"Do you mark that?","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--","book 6"
"What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'","book 6"

"this starting.","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.","book 6"
"Gentlewoman","book 6"
"She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of","book 6"
"that: heaven knows what she has known.","book 6"
"LADY MACBETH","book 6"
"Here's the smell of the blood still: all the","book 6"

"Doctor","book 6"
"What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.","book 6"
"Gentlewoman","book 6"
"I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the","book 6"

"Well, well, well,--","book 6"
"Gentlewoman","book 6"
"Pray God it be, sir.","book 6"

"Directly.","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds","book 6"

"God, God forgive us all! Look after her;","book 6"
"Remove from her the means of all annoyance,","book 6"
"And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:","book 6"

"Protest their first of manhood.","book 6"
"MENTEITH","book 6"
"What does the tyrant?","book 6"
"CAITHNESS","book 6"
"Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:","book 6"
"Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him","book 6"
"Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,","book 6"
"He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause","book 6"
"Within the belt of rule.","book 6"
"ANGUS","book 6"
"Now does he feel","book 6"
"His secret murders sticking on his hands;","book 6"
"Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;","book 6"
"Those he commands move only in command,","book 6"
"Nothing in love: now does he feel his title","book 6"
"Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe","book 6"
"Upon a dwarfish thief.","book 6"
"MENTEITH","book 6"
"Who then shall blame","book 6"
"His pester'd senses to recoil and start,","book 6"
"When all that is within him does condemn","book 6"
"Itself for being there?","book 6"
"CAITHNESS","book 6"
"Well, march we on,","book 6"
"To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:","book 6"
"Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,","book 6"
"And with him pour we in our country's purge","book 6"

"Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,","book 6"
"I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?","book 6"
"Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know","book 6"
"All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:","book 6"
"'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman","book 6"

"Servant","book 6"
"Soldiers, sir.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,","book 6"
"Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?","book 6"
"Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine","book 6"

"How does your patient, doctor?","book 6"
"Doctor","book 6"
"Not so sick, my lord,","book 6"
"As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,","book 6"
"That keep her from her rest.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Cure her of that.","book 6"
"Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,","book 6"
"Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,","book 6"
"Raze out the written troubles of the brain","book 6"
"And with some sweet oblivious antidote","book 6"
"Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff","book 6"
"Which weighs upon the heart?","book 6"

"Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast","book 6"

"I should report that which I say I saw,","book 6"
"But know not how to do it.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Well, say, sir.","book 6"
"Messenger","book 6"
"As I did stand my watch upon the hill,","book 6"
"I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,","book 6"
"The wood began to move.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Liar and slave!","book 6"
"Messenger","book 6"
"Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:","book 6"
"Within this three mile may you see it coming;","book 6"
"I say, a moving grove.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"If thou speak'st false,","book 6"
"Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,","book 6"
"Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,","book 6"
"I care not if thou dost for me as much.","book 6"
"I pull in resolution, and begin","book 6"
"To doubt the equivocation of the fiend","book 6"
"That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood","book 6"
"Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood","book 6"
"Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!","book 6"
"If this which he avouches does appear,","book 6"
"There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.","book 6"
"I gin to be aweary of the sun,","book 6"
"And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.","book 6"
"Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!","book 6"
"At least we'll die with harness on our back.","book 6"
"Exeunt","book 6"
"SCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle.","book 6"
"Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD, MACDUFF, and their Army, with boughs","book 6"
"MALCOLM","book 6"
"Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.","book 6"
"And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,","book 6"
"Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,","book 6"
"Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we","book 6"
"Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,","book 6"
"According to our order.","book 6"
"SIWARD","book 6"
"Fare you well.","book 6"
"Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,","book 6"
"Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,","book 6"
"Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.","book 6"
"Exeunt","book 6"
"SCENE VII. Another part of the field.","book 6"
"Alarums. Enter MACBETH","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,","book 6"
"But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he","book 6"
"That was not born of woman? Such a one","book 6"
"Am I to fear, or none.","book 6"
"Enter YOUNG SIWARD","book 6"
"YOUNG SIWARD","book 6"
"What is thy name?","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.","book 6"
"YOUNG SIWARD","book 6"
"No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name","book 6"
"Than any is in hell.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"My name's Macbeth.","book 6"
"YOUNG SIWARD","book 6"
"The devil himself could not pronounce a title","book 6"
"More hateful to mine ear.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"No, nor more fearful.","book 6"
"YOUNG SIWARD","book 6"
"Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword","book 6"
"I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.","book 6"
"They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Thou wast born of woman","book 6"
"But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,","book 6"
"Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.","book 6"
"Exit","book 6"
"Alarums. Enter MACDUFF","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!","book 6"
"If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,","book 6"
"My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.","book 6"
"I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms","book 6"
"Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,","book 6"
"Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge","book 6"
"I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;","book 6"
"By this great clatter, one of greatest note","book 6"
"Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!","book 6"
"And more I beg not.","book 6"
"Exit. Alarums","book 6"
"Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD","book 6"
"SIWARD","book 6"
"This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:","book 6"
"The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;","book 6"
"The noble thanes do bravely in the war;","book 6"
"The day almost itself professes yours,","book 6"
"And little is to do.","book 6"
"MALCOLM","book 6"
"We have met with foes","book 6"
"That strike beside us.","book 6"
"SIWARD","book 6"
"Enter, sir, the castle.","book 6"
"Exeunt. Alarums","book 6"
"SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.","book 6"
"Enter MACBETH","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Why should I play the Roman fool, and die","book 6"
"On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes","book 6"
"Do better upon them.","book 6"
"Enter MACDUFF","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"Turn, hell-hound, turn!","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Of all men else I have avoided thee:","book 6"
"But get thee back; my soul is too much charged","book 6"
"With blood of thine already.","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"I have no words:","book 6"
"My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain","book 6"
"Than terms can give thee out!","book 6"
"They fight","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Thou losest labour:","book 6"
"As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air","book 6"
"With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:","book 6"
"Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;","book 6"
"I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,","book 6"
"To one of woman born.","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"Despair thy charm;","book 6"
"And let the angel whom thou still hast served","book 6"
"Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb","book 6"
"Untimely ripp'd.","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,","book 6"
"For it hath cow'd my better part of man!","book 6"
"And be these juggling fiends no more believed,","book 6"
"That palter with us in a double sense;","book 6"
"That keep the word of promise to our ear,","book 6"
"And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"Then yield thee, coward,","book 6"
"And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:","book 6"
"We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,","book 6"
"Painted on a pole, and underwrit,","book 6"
"'Here may you see the tyrant.'","book 6"
"MACBETH","book 6"
"I will not yield,","book 6"
"To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,","book 6"
"And to be baited with the rabble's curse.","book 6"
"Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,","book 6"
"And thou opposed, being of no woman born,","book 6"
"Yet I will try the last. Before my body","book 6"
"I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,","book 6"
"And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'","book 6"
"Exeunt, fighting. Alarums","book 6"
"Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers","book 6"
"MALCOLM","book 6"
"I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.","book 6"
"SIWARD","book 6"
"Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,","book 6"
"So great a day as this is cheaply bought.","book 6"
"MALCOLM","book 6"
"Macduff is missing, and your noble son.","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:","book 6"
"He only lived but till he was a man;","book 6"
"The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd","book 6"
"In the unshrinking station where he fought,","book 6"
"But like a man he died.","book 6"
"SIWARD","book 6"
"Then he is dead?","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow","book 6"
"Must not be measured by his worth, for then","book 6"
"It hath no end.","book 6"
"SIWARD","book 6"
"Had he his hurts before?","book 6"
"ROSS","book 6"
"Ay, on the front.","book 6"
"SIWARD","book 6"
"Why then, God's soldier be he!","book 6"
"Had I as many sons as I have hairs,","book 6"
"I would not wish them to a fairer death:","book 6"
"And so, his knell is knoll'd.","book 6"
"MALCOLM","book 6"
"He's worth more sorrow,","book 6"
"And that I'll spend for him.","book 6"
"SIWARD","book 6"
"He's worth no more","book 6"
"They say he parted well, and paid his score:","book 6"
"And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.","book 6"
"Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head","book 6"
"MACDUFF","book 6"
"Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands","book 6"
"The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:","book 6"
"I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,","book 6"
"That speak my salutation in their minds;","book 6"
"Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:","book 6"
"Hail, King of Scotland!","book 6"
"ALL","book 6"
"Hail, King of Scotland!","book 6"
"Flourish","book 6"
"MALCOLM","book 6"
"We shall not spend a large expense of time","book 6"
"Before we reckon with your several loves,","book 6"
"And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,","book 6"
"Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland","book 6"
"In such an honour named. What's more to do,","book 6"
"Which would be planted newly with the time,","book 6"
"As calling home our exiled friends abroad","book 6"
"That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;","book 6"
"Producing forth the cruel ministers","book 6"
"Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,","book 6"
"Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands","book 6"
"Took off her life; this, and what needful else","book 6"
"That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,","book 6"
"We will perform in measure, time and place:","book 6"
"So, thanks to all at once and to each one,","book 6"
"Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.","book 6"
"Flourish. Exeunt","book 6"
