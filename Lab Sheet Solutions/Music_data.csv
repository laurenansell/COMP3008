"You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money - you still want more,
Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow - minded cronies who are fools of the first division-
Death on two legs -
You're tearing me apart,
Death on two legs
You never had a heard of your own -
Kill joy, Bad guy,
Big talking, Small fry
You're just an old barrow - boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me,
Can you face me -
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good, are you satisfied
Do you feel like suicide (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night,
Do you feel good - Feel good!
Talk like a big business tycoon,
But you're just a hot - air balloon,
So no one gives you a damn,
You're just an overgrown school - boy
Let me tan your hide.
A dog with disease,
King of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is Mr. Know all,
Was the fin on your back part of the deal...(shark!)
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs -
You never had a heart of your own,
(You never did, right from the start)
Insane you should be put inside,
You're a sewer - rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null - and - void,
Make me feel good
I feel good.",1
"I go out to work on Monday morning
Tuesday, I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday, I go waltzing to the zoo
I come from London town
I'm just an ordinary guy
Fridays, I go painting in the Louvre
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night
(There he goes again)
I'll be lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon",2
"The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons pumping
And the hubcaps all gleam
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When my hand's on your grease gun
Oh it's like a disease, son
I'm in love with my car
Got to feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal
Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks
Saying this is the end now
Cars don't talk back
They're just four-wheeled friends, now
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruising in overdrive
Don't have to listen
To no run of the mill talk jive
I'm in love with my car
Got to feel for my automobile
I'm in love with my car
String back gloves
In my automolove",3
"Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live
Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine and I want you to know
That my feelings are true, I really love you
Oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, I've been wandering 'round
Still dropped back to you (but I still come back to you)
In rain or shine you've stood by me, girl
I'm happy at home (happy at home)
You're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
OOh, you make me live
Oh, you're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one and I love the things
I really love the things that you do (ooh)
Oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
(Live, live, live)
I'm happy (happy at home)
You're my best friend
Oh, oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, you're my best friend",4
"In the year of '39, assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey, little darling, we'll away
But my love, this cannot be
Oh, so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand
For my life
Still ahead
Pity me",5
"Ooh, I like it
(Yeah)
You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
Ooh, you bring me down, you shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone
Ooh, you don't believe me
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady (sweet lady)
Ooh, stay sweet
You say
You call me up and feed me all the lies
You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese
Waiting on the shelf
You eat me up, you hold me down
I'm just a fool to make you a home, oh
Ooh, you really do me when you say
Sweet lady (sweet lady)
Sweet lady (sweet lady)
Sweet lady
Ooh, come on, stay sweet
My sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay, sweet, baby
Believe, and we've got everything we need (ah)
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Ooh, stay sweet (stay sweet)
Oh, runaway, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sweet lady",6
"Seaside, whenever you stroll along with me
Merely contemplating what you feel inside (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Meanwhile, I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could, but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand-new angle, highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous
I feel so romantic, can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime? (Ooh, I'd like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie, mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season, the Mediterranean
This time of year
It's so fashionable
I feel like dancing in the rain
Can I have a volunteer? (Just keep right on dancing)
What a damn jolly good idea
It's such a jollification as a matter of fact
So très charmant, my dear
Underneath the moonlight (ooh-ooh)
Together we'll sail across the sea (shine on, silvery moonlight)
Reminiscing every night (ooh)
Meantime (and in the meantime, baby) I ask you to be my Valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial, start a sensational
Seaside rendezvous, so adorable
Seaside rendezvous, whoo-hoo
Seaside rendezvous, give us a kiss",7
"Oh, oh, people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
""Beware the storm that gathers here""
Listen to the wise man
I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice-cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
""I see no day, "" I heard him say
""So grey is the face of every mortal""
Oh, oh, people of the earth
Listen to the warning the prophet he said
""For soon the cold of night will fall""
Summoned by your own hand
Ah, ah, children of the land
Quicken to the new life, take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove
He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late, all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own, his precious gain
The earth will shake, in two will break
And death all round will be your dowry
Ah, ah, people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
""For those who hear and mark my words""
Listen to the good plan
Ah, ah, ah, ah
And two by two, my human zoo
They'll be
(Running for to come)
(Running for to come out of the rain)
Oooh!, flee for your life
Who heed me not let all your treasure make you
Oooh!, fear for your life
Deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you
Ah, ah, people can you hear me?
People can you hear me?
People can you hear me?
And now I know, and now I know, and now I know
I know, I know that you can hear me
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
The earth will shake, in two will break
The earth will shake, in two will break
Death all around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know, now I know
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!
Listen to the wise
Listen to the wise man

Listen to the man
Listen to the mad man
God give you grace to purge this place
And peace all around may be your fortune
Ah, ah, children of the land
Love is still the answer, take my hand
The vision fades, a voice I hear
""Listen to the madman""
Ooh, but still I fear, still I dare not
Laugh at the madman",8
"Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, and now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
You will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side to remind you
How I still love you
(I still love you)
Back, hurry back
Please, bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh",9
"Take good care of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company
Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
Very soon, I begged her, won't you keep me company?
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Come marry me, forevermore, we'll be good company
Now marriage is an institution, sure
My wife and I, our needs, and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by, disappeared
But we're safe enough behind our door
I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts
My own limited company
I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company
All through the years, in the end, it appears
There was never really anyone but me
Now I'm old, I puff my pipe
But no one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company",10
"Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah!
No, we will not let you go (let him go)
Bismillah!
We will not let you go (let him go)
Bismillah!
We will not let you go (let me go)
Will not let you go (let me go)
Never, never, never, never let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia
Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me",11
